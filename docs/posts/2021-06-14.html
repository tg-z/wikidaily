<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2104415>CD single</a><br><p>A <b>CD single</b> (sometimes abbreviated to <b>CDS</b>) is a music single in the form of a compact disc. The standard in the Red Book for the term <i>CD single</i> is an 8 cm (3-inch) CD (or <b>Mini CD</b>). It now refers to any single recorded onto a CD of any size, particularly the CD5, or 5-inch CD single. The format was introduced in the mid-1980s but did not gain its place in the market until the early 1990s. With the rise in digital downloads and streaming in the early 2010s, sales of CD singles have decreased.
</p><p>Commercially released CD singles can vary in length from two songs (an A side and B side, in the tradition of 7-inch 45-rpm records) up to six songs like an EP. Some contain multiple mixes of one or more songs (known as remixes), in the tradition of 12-inch vinyl singles, and in some cases, they may also contain a music video for the single itself (this is an enhanced CD) as well as a collectible poster. Depending on the nation, there may be limits on the number of songs and total length for sales to count in singles charts.

<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/John_Canton_from_NPG.jpg/41px-John_Canton_from_NPG.jpg><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=465034>John Canton</a><br><p><b>John Canton</b> FRS (31 July 1718 – 22 March 1772) was a British physicist. He was born in Middle Street Stroud, Gloucestershire, the son of a weaver John Canton (b. 1687) and Esther (née Davis). As a schoolboy, he became the first person to determine the latitude of Stroud, whilst making a sundial. The sundial caught the attention of many, including Dr Henry Miles, a Stroud-born Fellow of the Royal Society. Miles encouraged Canton to leave Gloucestershire to become a trainee teacher for Samuel Watkins, the headmaster of a Nonconformist school in Spital Square, London, with whom he ultimately entered into partnership.
</p>

<p>In 1750 he read a paper before the Royal Society on a method of making artificial magnets, which procured him election as a fellow of the society. In 1751 he was a recipient of the Copley Medal "On account of his communicating to the Society, and exhibiting before them, his curious method of making Artificial Magnets without the use of Natural ones." He was the first in England to verify Benjamin Franklin's hypothesis of the identity of lightning and electricity, and he made several important electrical discoveries.
</p><p>In 1762 and 1764 he published experiments in refutation of the decision of the Florentine Academy, at that time generally accepted, that water is incompressible. In 1768 he described the preparation, by calcining oyster-shell with sulphur, of the phosphorescent material known as Canton's phosphorus. His investigations were carried on without any intermission of his work as a schoolmaster. He died in London aged 53 of dropsy.
</p><p>He was the recipient of letters from Thomas Bayes, which were then published by the Royal Society.
</p><p>He is now mainly remembered for his work in electrostatics, particularly the invention of the pith ball electroscope, and his studies in atmospheric electricity.

</p>
<p>The <b>Williams Olefins Plant explosion</b> occurred on June 13, 2013 at a petrochemical plant located in Geismar, an unincorporated and largely industrial area 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Two workers were killed and 114 injured. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) launched investigations to determine how and why the heat exchanger failed. The Chemical Safety Board concluded that a standby heat exchanger had filled with hydrocarbon. This heat exchanger was isolated from its pressure relief; shortly after the heat exchanger was heated with hot water, the hydrocarbon flashed to vapor, ruptured the heat exchanger, and exploded.</p><p>The effects of the explosion were felt several miles away. Senator Troy Brown [D-Napoleonville], who was at his home five miles from the plant when the blast occurred, said, "For about a good two to three seconds, it felt like an earthquake." A shelter-in-place order was issued to residences and businesses within a two-mile (3.2 km) radius of the plant.</p>
