</p><p>In a comical manner, the movie tells the story how the ridiculous prejudices of the people in the countryside can bring troubles just like that when two different lifestyles are faced to each other. The film perfectly shows the way of life of the typical Bulgarian family in the villages or the small towns from that time.
