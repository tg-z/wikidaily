The design was originally developed for the American-Hawaiian Lines in 1941, but in late 1941 the plans were taken over by the MARCOM.
</p><p>Eighty-one ships were built as cargo or troopships in four shipyards: Kaiser Richmond, California (35 ships), Kaiser Vancouver, Washington (20 ships), Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock in Chester, Pennsylvania (20 ships) and Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point, Maryland (6 ships). All ships were capable of 17 knots (31 km/h; 20 mph), driven by a single screw steam turbine generating 9,900 shaft horsepower (7,400 kW).
</p><p>Among the variations of the design were the <i>Haven</i>-class hospital ship.
</p><p>They were followed post-war by thirty-seven of the larger C4-S-1 class, also known as the <i>Mariner</i> class.</p><br><br>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=7565912>Gift offering</a><br><p>A <b>meal offering</b>, <b>grain offering</b>, or <b>gift offering</b> (Hebrew: <span lang="he" dir="rtl">מנחה</span>‎, <i>minkhah</i>),  is a type of Biblical sacrifice, specifically a sacrifice that did not include sacrificial animals. In older English it is sometimes called an oblation, from Latin.
</p><p>The Hebrew noun <i>minkhah</i> (מִנְחָה) is used 211 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible with the first instances being the <i>minkhah</i> offered by both Cain and Abel in Genesis 4:3-5. It is also used of Jacob's "present" to Esau in Genesis 32 and again of the "present" to the Egyptian ruler (in fact Joseph his son) in Genesis 43.  
</p><p>In the King James Version of 1611 this was rendered as "meat offerings", e.g. in Exodus 29:41, since at the time the King James Version was written, <i>meat</i> referred to food in general rather than the flesh of animals in particular.

It is Taiwan's most complete surviving example of traditional Chinese garden architecture. The Lin Family Mansion and Garden — along with the Tainan Wu Garden, Hsinchu Beiguo Garden (新竹北郭園), and Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden — are collectively known as the Four Great Gardens of Taiwan (台灣四大名園). This residence can be traced back to 1847, at the time a "rent house" for the Lin Ben Yuan family in the north. It was later expanded by the brothers Lin Guohua and Lin Guofang, becoming the residence of the Lin Ben Yuan family. Currently, the Lin Family Mansion and Garden is under the joint responsibility of the Executive Yuan Cultural Construction Committee, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Transportation and Communications Tourism Bureau, Taiwan Provincial Government, and the New Taipei City Government for protection and restoration work, who have additionally designated it as a Class-2 Historical Site.
</p><p>The Lin Family Mansion and Garden has a surface area of approximately 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres). The garden is also referred to as the Banqiao Lin Family Garden (板橋林家花園). The Three-Courtyard Mansion to the west of the garden belongs to the Lin Family Sacrificial Trade Association. It is necessary to have a tour guide lead to enter the mansion's interior.
