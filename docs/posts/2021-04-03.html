Key's fourth game, <i>Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet</i>, was also released in 2004 with a rating for all ages, and is described as a "kinetic novel" by the development team because of its completely linear storyline.</p><p>Key's fifth game, <i>Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life</i>, was released in 2005 as an adult game and spin-off from <i>Clannad</i>; it expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami.

Ecstasy</i>, was an expanded, adult version of <i>Little Busters!</i> released in 2008.

The first volume in the episodic <i>Angel Beats!</i> visual novel was released in 2015. Key released the kinetic novel <i>Harmonia</i> in 2016, and later the visual novel <i>Summer Pockets</i> in 2018. An expanded version of <i>Summer Pockets</i> titled <i>Summer Pockets Reflection Blue</i> was released in 2020.</p><p>As of June 2020, 47 versions of Key's 14 released visual novels have been published by VisualArt's.

Key released a box set called "Key 10th Memorial Box" in July 2009 containing six of Key's visual novels with a rating for all ages.
