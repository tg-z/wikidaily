</p>


<p>The <b>culture of South Africa</b> is known for its ethnic and cultural diversity. Among black South Africans, a substantial number of rural inhabitants lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as South Africans have become increasingly urbanized and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined. Urban South Africans usually speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native language. There are smaller but still significant groups of speakers of Khoisan languages, not included in the eleven official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognised languages. There are small groups of speakers of endangered languages, most of which are from the Khoisan family, that receive no official status; however, some groups within South Africa are attempting to promote their use and revival.
</p><p>Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white and Indian but whose ranks include growing numbers of other communities of colour, have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand.
</p><p>The Apartheid state legally classified South Africans into one of four race groups, and determined where they could live, and enforced segregation in education, work opportunities, public amenities and social relations. Although these laws were abolished by the early 1990s, the apartheid racial categories remain ingrained in South African culture, with South Africans continuing to classify themselves, and each other, as belonging to one of the four defined race groups (black Africans, whites, Coloureds and Indians) making it difficult to define a single <i>South African culture</i> that doesn't make reference to these racial categories.</p>
