Barco</a><br><p><b>Bailey Barco</b> (February 14, 1846 - November 4, 1901) was a heroic stationkeeper with the United States Life-Saving Service—one of the agencies later merged into the United States Coast Guard.  He led a heroic rescue at his station in Virginia Beach, on December 21, 1900.</p><p>A severe storm had grounded the schooner <i>Jennie Hall</i>, which was being beaten to pieces on its sandbank. Barco decided the surf was too severe to launch his station's surfboat.  But his crew was able to send a line to the vessel, and bring off most of the surviving crew with a breeches-buoy.
</p><p>The last surviving crew member was too numb with cold, and required assistance.  Attempts to carry a rescuer out to the schooner with the breeches-buoy were unsuccessful, so Barco and one of his crew made several attempts to use the surfboat to reach the stranded man. They finally succeeded, and were able to put two rescuers aboard the vessel, who were able to assist the last man to mount the breeches-buoy.
</p><p>Barco was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal on October 7, 1901.</p><p>Barco was a fisherman, machinist, boat builder, and wrecker by trade. With his wife, Virginia Williams Barco, he had nine children, seven of whom survived; many of their descendants continue to live in the Virginia Beach area. Barco oversaw construction of the Chapel by the Sea, the Eastern Shore Chapel, in Dam Neck, and is buried in its cemetery.</p><br><br>
