The high point is Monte Calvo at 1,065 m (3,494 ft). Most of the upland area, about 1,200 km<sup>2</sup> (460 sq mi), is part of the Gargano National Park, founded in 1991. In this region since 1978 a feud has been fought between the clans of the Società foggiana.</p><p>The Gargano peninsula is partly covered by the remains of an ancient forest, <i>Foresta Umbra</i>, the only remaining part in Italy of the ancient oak and beech forest that once covered much of Central Europe as well as the Apennine deciduous montane forests ecoregion. The Latin poet Horace spoke of the oaks of <i>Garganus</i> in <i>Ode</i> II, ix.

</p>
<p><i><b>Chunnelodon</b></i> is a genus of extinct mammal from the Early Cretaceous of Southern England. The type and only species is <i><b>Chunnelodon alopekodes</b></i>, represented by two lower molars from the Sunnydown Farm locality of the Lulworth Formation of Dorset. The taxon was described by Paul Ensom and Denise Sigogneau-Russell in 1998, who gave the species name from the translation of the Ancient Greek phrase "sly as a fox", with the generic name honouring the British-French collaboration and the newly inaugurated Channel Tunnel. <i>Chunnelodon</i> is diagnosed by multiple features of the dental anatomy including slightly asymmetrical but aligned roots, sharp cusps, a tall protoconid and metaconid, a small paraconid, and a reduced talonid. While it was only assigned to Cladotheria indeterminate, <i>Chunnelodon</i> was likely closely related to Dryolestoidea, although outside the clade.</p>
