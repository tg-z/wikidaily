<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=24298124>Derailment (thought disorder)</a><br><p>In psychiatry, <b>derailment</b> (also <b>loosening of association</b>, <b>asyndesis</b>, <b>asyndetic thinking</b>, <b>knight's move thinking</b>, or <b>entgleisen</b>) is a thought disorder characterized by discourse consisting of a sequence of unrelated or only remotely related ideas. The frame of reference often changes from one sentence to the next.</p><p>In a mild manifestation, this thought disorder is characterized by slippage of ideas further and further from the point of a discussion. Derailment can often be manifestly caused by intense emotions such as euphoria or hysteria. Some of the synonyms given above (<i>loosening of association</i>, <i>asyndetic thinking</i>) are used by some authors to refer just to a <i>loss of goal</i>: discourse that sets off on a particular idea, wanders off and never returns to it. A related term is tangentiality—it refers to off-the-point, oblique or irrelevant answers given to questions. In some studies on creativity, <i>knight's move thinking</i>, while it describes a similarly loose association of ideas, is not considered a mental disorder or the hallmark of one; it is sometimes used as a synonym for lateral thinking.</p>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=29605965>Life satisfaction</a><br><p><b>Life satisfaction</b> (LS) is the way in which people show their emotions, feelings (moods) and how they feel about their directions and options for the future.  It is a measure of well-being assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, self-concepts, and self-perceived ability to cope with one's daily life. Life satisfaction involves a favorable attitude towards one's life rather than an assessment of current feelings. Life satisfaction has been measured in relation to economic standing, degree of education, experiences, residence, among many other topics.</p><p>Life satisfaction is a key part of subjective wellbeing. There are many factors both internal and external that contribute to one's subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction. (Diener, 2021).
