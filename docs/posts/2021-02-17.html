Part of the <i>sestiere</i> (quarter) of Santa Croce,  it is situated between the Palazzo Belloni Battagia and Palazzo Duodo, near the church of San Stae. It is owned by the Università Iuav di Venezia and houses the Department of Design and Planning in Complex Environments.
</p><p>The palace was rebuilt in the late 16th century, under the design of an unknown architect influenced by Jacopo Sansovino as the residence of the Tron family, who lived here until their extinction in the 19th century. The Tron had lived in this parish by the time of the start of the Patriciate. The family produced on Doge, Niccolo Tron in 1471, and nearly a half dozen procurators, and many other Venetian statesmen and generals. Maximilian, Elector of Bavaria, stayed here in 1684; and in 1775 Andrea Tron entertained the Emperor Joseph II with a magnificent ball. Senator Francesco Tron, grandson of Andrea, died here in 1793. In the 19th century the palace nearly fell into ruin.</p><p>It has been owned by the Università Iuav di Venezia since 1972.
