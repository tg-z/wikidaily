<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9654206>Smile (Lyle Lovett album)</a><br><p><i><b>Smile</b></i> is a 2003 compilation of songs performed by Lyle Lovett for various movie soundtracks between 1992 and 2002.   <i>Smile</i> was the fifth project by Lovett that did <i>not</i> introduce a new collection of his own songs during the expanse of time between his 1996 Grammy winning <i>The Road to Ensenada</i> and <i>My Baby Don't Tolerate</i> (released later in 2003).  Other projects included a 1998 cover album, a 1999 live album, a 2000 movie soundtrack, and a 2001 anthology.  The release of <i>Smile</i> led some reviewers to speculate the Lovett might be experiencing some sort of writer's block.  Another possibility is that Lovett was taking it easy following a 2002 injury from an accident involving a bull on a family farm in Texas.  During the incident Lovett's leg was broken in 20 places.  A fracture to his thumb also left him unable to play guitar for an extended period.</p><p>The album has been described as a "nice listen" and "nice for collectors" to find all of these songs together, but "not essential,"  and "uneven." </p>
