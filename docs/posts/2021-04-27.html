It also imaged Uranus' five large moons, revealing that their surfaces are covered with impact craters and canyons.
</p><p>A number of dedicated exploratory missions to Uranus have been proposed, but as of 2020 none have been approved.</p>

<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Change_up_1.JPG/37px-Change_up_1.JPG><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=467842>Changeup</a><br><p>A <b>changeup</b> is a type of pitch in baseball and fastpitch softball. The changeup is the staple off-speed pitch, usually thrown to look like a fastball but arriving much more slowly to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter's timing. It is meant to be thrown the same as a fastball, but farther back in the hand, which makes it release from the hand slower while still retaining the look of a fastball. A changeup is generally thrown to be 8–15 miles per hour slower than a fastball. If thrown correctly, the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye cannot discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around 30 feet from the plate. For example, a batter swings at the ball coming at him as if it were a 90 mph fastball, but instead the ball is coming in at 75 mph—this means he will be swinging too early to hit the ball well.
</p><p>Other names include <b>change-of-pace</b>,  <b>change</b> or <b>off-speed pitch</b>. Although that term can also be used simply to mean any pitch that is slower than a fastball. In addition, before at least the second half of the twentieth century, the term "slow ball" was used to denote pitches that were not a fastball or breaking ball, which almost always meant a type of changeup. Therefore, the terms <i>slow ball</i> and <i>changeup</i> could be used interchangeably.
</p><p>The changeup is analogous to the slower ball in cricket.
