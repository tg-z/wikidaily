<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=113442>The Right Stuff (film)</a><br><p><i><b>The Right Stuff</b></i> is a 1983 American epic historical drama film written for the screen and directed by Philip Kaufman. It is based on the 1979 book of the same name by Tom Wolfe. It follows the Navy, Marine, and Air Force test pilots who were involved in aeronautical research at Edwards Air Force Base, California, as well as the Mercury Seven, the seven military pilots who were selected to be the astronauts for Project Mercury, the first human spaceflight by the United States. The film stars Sam Shepard, Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, Dennis Quaid, and Barbara Hershey. Levon Helm narrates and plays Air Force test pilot Jack Ridley.
</p><p>The film was a box-office bomb, grossing about $21 million against a $27 million budget. Despite this, it received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for eight Oscars at the 56th Academy Awards, four of which it won. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>
