The mountain is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains, which runs along the northern east side of Pinkham Notch.  North Carter is flanked to the northeast by Imp Mountain, and to the southwest by Middle Carter Mountain.
</p><p>Although well over 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in height, the Appalachian Mountain Club doesn't consider North Carter a "four-thousand footer" because the col on the ridge from Middle Carter only descends 60 feet (18 m), making it a secondary summit of that peak.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=17633221>Judah Kyriakos</a><br><p><b>Judah Kyriakos</b>, also known popularly as <b>Judas of Jerusalem</b>, was the great-grandson of Jude, brother of Jesus, and the last Jewish Bishop of Jerusalem, according to Epiphanius of Salamis and Eusebius of Caesarea. He is sometimes regarded as the great grand-nephew of Jesus.
</p><p>Though the start of his period as bishop of Jerusalem is not known, Judas is said to have lived beyond the Bar Kokhba's revolt (132-136), up to about the eleventh year of Antoninus Pius (c. AD 148) though Marcus was appointed bishop of Aelia Capitolina in 135 by the Metropolitan of Caesarea.
</p><p>He is also mentioned in the apocryphal Letter of <i>James to Quadratus</i>.</p>
