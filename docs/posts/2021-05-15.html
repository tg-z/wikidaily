</p><p class="mw-empty-elt">
</p>
<p><i><b>Nebojša</b></i> was the second of the <i>Hrabri</i>-class diesel-electric submarines built by the Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom, for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) and was launched in 1927. Her design was based on that of the British L-class submarine of World War I, and she was built using parts originally assembled for a Royal Navy L-class submarine that was never built. She was armed with six bow-mounted 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tubes, two 102 mm (4 in) guns and one machine gun, and could dive to 60 metres (200 ft).
</p><p>Prior to World War II <i>Nebojša</i> participated in cruises to several Mediterranean ports. During the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she evaded capture by Italian forces, and joined British naval forces in the Mediterranean where she performed a training role. After the war she was taken over by the new Yugoslav government and renamed <i><b>Tara</b></i>. She was eventually stricken in 1954, and scrapped in 1958.

During the 20th century, the differences between these two belief systems were also highlighted.</p><p>Despite surface level and non-scholarly analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have inherent and fundamental differences at the deepest levels, beginning with monotheism's place at the core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism and its rejection of the notion of a creator deity, which runs counter to teachings about God in Christianity; and extending to the importance of Grace in Christianity against the rejection of interference with Karma in Theravada Buddhism, etc.</p><p>The central iconic imagery of the two traditions underscore the difference in their belief structure, when the peaceful death of Gautama Buddha at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement for the sins of humanity. Buddhists scholars such as Masao Abe see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the two belief systems.</p><p>Most modern scholarship has rejected the claims for the travels of Jesus to India or Tibet or influences between the teachings of Christianity and Buddhism as not historical, and has seen the attempts at parallel symbolism as cases of parallelomania which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Faith, Unity, Discipline</b> (Urdu: <span lang="ur" dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl" title="Nastaliq">ایمان، اتحاد، نظم</span></span>‎) is the national motto of Pakistan. It is regarded as the guiding principle of Pakistan's nationhood.</p>
<p>Upon the independence of Pakistan, it was introduced and adopted as the national motto by the country's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It is inscribed in Urdu at the base of the state emblem. The emblem itself is an adaptation of four components: wreath, crescent, star and scroll, with all components in the shield bounded by the wreath of the Jasmine flower, and the crescent and star crest depicted at the top.</p>
