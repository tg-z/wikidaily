The church and its rectory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as <b>Trinity Church and Rectory</b>.
</p><p>The Trinity Episcopal parish is one of the five oldest Episcopal parishes in Tennessee, established in 1832. Its first church building was completed in 1838. It was the second permanent church building in Clarksville, preceded only by a Methodist church built a few years earlier.</p><p>The church remained open through the Civil War, including the Union Army occupation of Clarksville. Its rector, the Rev'd Samuel Ringgold, convinced Union leaders to allow it to remain open, telling them that the value of "decent and orderly" worship should transcend both politics and war.</p><p>The original building was demolished in 1873 and replaced by the current Romanesque-style building, which was completed in 1877 and is faced with rough-cut gray stone. The rectory was built in 1883 and a parish house was added in 1916. Renovations in the 1920s and 1980s maintained the historic integrity of the original design.</p><p>Trinity Church and Rectory were added to the National Register in 1982. A tornado on January 22, 1999, destroyed the parish house, knocked over part of the steeple and severely damaged the church roof. Subsequently, the church building was restored and a new parish house was built.</p>

They played only two years, 1967 in the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and 1968 in the North American Soccer League (NASL). Their home field was Varsity Stadium.
</p><p>During the 1967 season, while still in the NPSL, the Falcons drew an average of 3,792 people per game. Toronto's record for the 1967 season was a bearable 10-5-17. The following season, the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the NASL. Their intercity rival, Toronto City, of USL folded in the process after only one year.</p><p>In the NASL, with the legendary László Kubala as their coach, the Falcons played well collecting a 13-6-13 record, but financial troubles caused the club (along with 11 others) to fold. Their average attendance for the 1968 season was 5,336 people per game. The NASL would return to Toronto in 1971 in the form of the Toronto Metros.

(31 January 1754 – 30 September 1756)), was a London weekly eighteenth century newspaper founded and chiefly run by George Colman the Elder and the parodist Bonnell Thornton as a 'plebeian' counterpart to Edward Moore's <i>The World</i>, a periodical of about the same time, which dealt more with the interests of aristocrats. James Boswell says in his <i>Life of Johnson</i>:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>"I mentioned the periodical paper called 'THE CONNOISSEUR'. He said it wanted matter. — No doubt it had not the deep thinking of Johnson's writings. But surely it has just views of the surface of life, and a very sprightly manner. His opinion of 'THE WORLD' was not much higher than of 'THE CONNOISSEUR'.</p></blockquote>
