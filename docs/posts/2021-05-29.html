</p>
<p>The <b>Northern Ontario School of Medicine</b> (French: <i lang="fr">École de médecine du Nord de l'Ontario</i>) is a medical school in the Canadian province of Ontario, created through a partnership between Laurentian University in Sudbury and Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. Mandated both to educate doctors and to contribute to care in Northern Ontario's urban, rural and remote communities, the Northern Ontario School of Medicine has campuses in both Sudbury and Thunder Bay.</p><p>The school is known for its small class size, its distributed model of education, heavy emphasis on enabling technologies, problem-based and self-directed learning, and early exposure to clinical skills.  The school describes its campus as "Northern Ontario".  This is evidenced by the close relationship between the school and various communities and First Nations throughout the region.  All students complete a month-long placement in an Aboriginal or Métis community in May of their first year.  In second year, they travel to smaller communities for two, month-long placements (one in the fall and the other in the winter).  The third year is clerkship and is spent living in one of the medium-sized communities for the entire year.  The fourth year of studies is completed in Sudbury or Thunder Bay.

The first, second and third award ceremonies were simply named 'Competition'. The award ceremonies were held at the Tokyo International Anime Fair (TAF) until 2013. In 2014, after the merger of the Tokyo International Anime Fair with the Anime Contents Expo and the formation of the AnimeJapan convention, the Tokyo Anime Awards was changed into a separate festival called <b>Tokyo Anime Awards Festival</b> (TAAF).
</p><p>Notably, there are <i>Open Entry Awards</i> for amateur creators (the Grand Prize winner is awarded with one million yen). Though there are ten main judges, the total number of judges is over one hundred people. Various groups participate in judging the festival, such as anime studio staff members, professors of universities, as well as producers and chief editors of various magazines. (<i>See also</i>: Animation Kobe).
