</p>


<p><b>Montello</b> is a hill in the province of Treviso, Veneto, northern Italy, and the site of a World War I battle.
</p><p>The bean-shaped hill measures about 5 km north-south by 13 km east-west.  It rises to a maximum of 371 m elevation from the alluvial plain of the Piave River, which runs along the north and west edges of the hill, at about 140 m elevation.
</p><p>Montello is crossed in the east-west direction by a local road that begins as Via 18 Giugno in the town of Pederiva di Biadene, continues as Strada La Dorsale and Via Frati, and ends as Via Ossario in the town of Nervesa della Battaglia. Several local roads in the general north-south direction connect this "dorsal spine" of the Montello to the two main alternative routes around the hill, either along on its southern margin (comprised by Stradone del Bosco, Via Fra Giocondo, Via Pedemontana, Via Francesco Baracca, Via Arditi, Via Armando Diaz) or along the northern margin (the Panoramic Road, comprised by Via Gabriele d'Annunzio, Via Nord Montello, Via Riviera Piave, Via Decima Armata).
</p><p>The hill gave its name to several towns nested against its base Crocetta del Montello, Montebelluna, Volpago del Montello, Giavera del Montello, and Nervesa della Battaglia.
</p><p>The hill is covered with a mix of wooded areas, residential homes, and small farms.  The church and monument of Santa Maria della Vittoria, built after the battle of 1918, is located on top of Montello, about 3.5 km north of Volpago (to which it belongs) and 5 km east from Pederiva.

Like most of the western part of the province, Christianity appears have arrived only in late antiquity with references to the diocese coming only after the Council of Nicaea.

The only known bishop from antiquity is Donato, who took part in the synod assembled in Carthage in 484 by the Arian King Huneric the Vandal, after which Donato was exiled. The bishopric appears to have effectively ceased with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. Today Subbar survives as a titular bishopric  and the most recent bishop is Joseph Robert Binzer, Auxiliary Bishop of Cincinnati, who replaced Cherubim Dambui in 2010 and resigned in 2020.</p><br><br>
