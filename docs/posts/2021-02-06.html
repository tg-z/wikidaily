</p>

<p>The <i>flora</i> consists of many unique varieties of tropical plants. Blessed with a tropical climate and around 17,000 islands, Indonesia is a nation with the second largest biodiversity in the world. The <b>flora of Indonesia</b> reflects an intermingling of Asian, Australian and the native species. This is due to the geography of Indonesia, located between two continents.
The archipelago consists of a variety of regions from the tropical rain forests of the northern lowlands and the seasonal forests of the southern lowlands through the hill and mountain vegetation, to subalpine shrub vegetation. Having the second longest shoreline in the world, Indonesia also has many regions of swamps and coastal vegetation. Combined together, these all give rise to a huge vegetational biodiversity.
There are about 28,000 species of flowering plants in Indonesia, consisting 2500 different kinds of orchids, 6000 traditional medicinal plants used as Jamu., 122 species of bamboo, over 350 species of rattan and 400 species of <i>Dipterocarpus</i>, including ebony, sandalwood and teakwood.
Indonesia is also home to some unusual species such as carnivorous plants. One exceptional species is known as <i>Rafflesia arnoldi</i>, named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr. Thomas Arnold, who discovered the flower in the depths of Bengkulu, southwest Sumatra. This parasitic plant has a large flower, does not produce leaves and grow on a certain liana on the rain forest floor. Another unusual plant is <i>Amorphophallus titanum</i> from Sumatra. Numerous species of insect trapping pitcher plants (<i>Nepenthes</i> spp.) can also be found in Borneo, Sumatra, and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=32349493>Explanatory combinatorial dictionary</a><br><p>An <b>explanatory combinatorial dictionary</b> (ECD) is a type of monolingual dictionary designed to be part of a meaning-text linguistic model of a natural language. It is intended to be a complete record of the lexicon of a given language.  As such, it identifies and describes, in separate entries, each of the language's lexemes (roughly speaking, each word or set of inflected forms based on a single stem) and phrasemes (roughly speaking, idioms and other multi-word fixed expressions). Among other things, each entry contains (1) a definition that incorporates a lexeme's semantic actants (for example, the definiendum of <i>give</i> takes the form <i>X gives Y to Z</i>, where its three actants are expressed —  the giver <i>X</i>, the thing given <i>Y</i>, and the person given to, <i>Z</i>) (2) complete information on lexical co-occurrence (e.g. the entry for <i>attack</i> tells you that one of its collocations is <i>launch an attack</i>, the entry for <i>party</i> provides <i>throw a party</i>, and the entry for <i>lecture</i> provides <i>deliver a lecture</i> — enabling the user to avoid making an error like *<i>deliver a party</i>); (3) an extensive set of examples. The ECD is a production dictionary — that is, it aims to provide all the information needed for a foreign learner or automaton to produce perfectly formed utterances of the language. Since the lexemes and phrasemes of a natural language number in the hundreds of thousands, a complete ECD, in paper form, would occupy the space of a large encyclopaedia. Such a work has yet to be achieved; while ECDs of Russian and French have been published, each describes less than one percent of the vocabulary of the respective languages.
</p><p>The ECD was proposed in the late 1960s by Aleksandr Žolkovskij and Igor Mel'čuk and was later further developed by Jurij Apresjan. Three ECDs are currently available in print, one for Russian, and two for French. A dictionary of Spanish collocations—DICE (= Diccionario de colocaciones del español)—is under development.</p><br><br>
