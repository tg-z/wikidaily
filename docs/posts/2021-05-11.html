<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1206204>Pervis Ellison</a><br><p><b>Pervis Ellison</b> (born April 3, 1967) is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) player.
</p><p>Ellison was nicknamed "<b>Never Nervous Pervis</b>" for his play with the University of Louisville.  At 6 ft 9 in and 242 lb, he started all four years as the center under coach Denny Crum.  In his freshman year he led Louisville to its second national championship and was named the Most Outstanding Player—the second time a freshman had ever been awarded that honor, after Arnie Ferrin in 1944 for Utah.
</p><p>Ellison was made the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. Teammate Danny Ainge gave Ellison the nickname "<b>Out of Service Pervis</b>" for the many injuries that would plague him during his professional career. An injury kept him on the sidelines for 48 of 82 games of his rookie year, after which he was traded to the Washington Bullets in a three-team trade involving the Utah Jazz that also sent Jeff Malone to the Jazz and Eric Leckner, Bob Hansen, and draft picks to the Kings. Although he was assigned as a backup in 1990–1991, the following year he became a starter and earned Most Improved Player honors after averaging 20.0 points, 11.4 rebounds and 2.68 blocks per game.  Arguably the best game of Ellison's NBA career occurred on January 31, 1992, when he recorded 19 points, 19 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 blocked shots and 2 steals against the Knicks.
</p><p>Assorted injuries plagued his career, including two knee problems that kept him benched for 29 games in 1992–1993 and 30 games in 1993–1994.  Ellison signed with the Boston Celtics after he was released by Washington in April 1994, but did not play until midway through the following season because he was still rehabilitating from knee problems.  A broken toe suffered while moving furniture kept him out of most games between 1996 and 1998. After participating in 69 out of a possible 246 games over the final three seasons with the Celtics, he joined the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000 but retired after playing nine games. He once coached basketball for Life Center Academy in Burlington, New Jersey and is a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey.</p>

</p>

<p><i><b>Glenada</b></i> is an ex-Canadian navy tugboat that was launched in 1943. <i>Glenada</i> was built by Russel Brothers Limited in Owen Sound, Ontario. It is one of twenty 1943 Glen-class tugs, eleven of which were built by the Russel Brothers Company. When it served for the Royal Canadian Navy the official number for this boat was (W30) 177886 and the Canadian Navy number was 534.  The Glen-class tugs were made in two designs (designated "A" and "B"); <i>Glenada</i> is an "A" design, with a longer main deck house, extending aft over the engine room, and uniform height bulwarks from forward to aft. A lifeboat is mounted on the bridgedeck aft of the stack. <i>Glenada</i> was originally powered by one Vivian 320 hp (240 kW) 8-cylinder diesel (400 hp (300 kW) with supercharger).
</p><p>After it was decommissioned from the navy it was registered in Montreal in 1956, and used by Sandrin Bros. in Sarnia, Ontario until 1995 when it was purchased by Thunder Bay Tug Services who still owns/runs it in Lake Superior.</p><p>In 1977 <i>Glenada</i> was widened 2 feet (0.61 m) on each side. In 1977 the main engine suffered serious damage while assisting a ship named <i>Hilda Marjanne</i> in the St. Clair River. This led to the engine was being swapped out for a Caterpillar D399 V16 turbo-charged diesel engine that produces 1,100 hp (820 kW) at 1200 RPM. The tug has two generators, a Detroit Diesel 3-71 generator and a John Deere 4-cylinder diesel generator.
