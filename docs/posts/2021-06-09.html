<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=44787801>Bitch I'm Madonna</a><br><p class="mw-empty-elt">

</p>
<p>"<b>Bitch I'm Madonna</b>" is a song by American singer Madonna from her thirteenth studio album, <i>Rebel Heart</i> (2015), featuring guest vocals from rapper Nicki Minaj. The artists co-wrote the song with MoZella, Toby Gad, Ariel Rechtshaid, Diplo, and Sophie. It was released as the third single from the album by Interscope Records on June 15, 2015, along with a number of remixes commissioned. Produced by Madonna and Diplo, it is an EDM, trap, electro, dubstep and electropop song with lyrics about Madonna having continuous fun because she is Madonna.
</p><p>The song divided music critics, as some called it "energetic", applauding Minaj's rap verse and its unusual composition, while others criticized it for being "desperate to shock". In the United States, "Bitch I'm Madonna" became the first Madonna song to enter the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in three years, peaking at number 84. The song became Minaj's 63rd and Madonna's 57th Hot 100 entry, placing them at positions three and four on the list of women with the most entries on the chart. It also reached number-one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, extending Madonna's lead as the artist with the most number-ones on the US dance chart. Worldwide, the song has reached the top-thirty in Hungary, and the digital charts of Finland and Sweden.
</p><p>The song's accompanying video, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, has Minaj and Diplo appearing alongside Madonna. The video also contains cameos from Diplo, Rita Ora, Chris Rock, Jon Kortajarena, Miley Cyrus, Alexander Wang, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Kanye West, and Madonna's two sons, Rocco and David. It was shot at the Standard Hotel in New York City and shows Madonna and her entourage having a party throughout the building, ending at the rooftop. The release of the video to the streaming service Tidal was plagued by technical difficulties and was met with a mixed response. Critics complimented the craziness of the clip but panned the absence of the guest stars from the set. Additionally, comparisons ensued with then recently released music video for singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's single "Bad Blood", which had featured similar guest stars. In order to further promote the song, Madonna performed "Bitch I'm Madonna" during her appearance on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, which was received positively. It was also performed as the second song of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016).
