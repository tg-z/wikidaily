<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Cirrus_vertebratus.jpg/50px-Cirrus_vertebratus.jpg><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=32398171>Cirrus vertebratus</a><br><p><b>Cirrus vertebratus</b> is a type of cirrus cloud. The name <i>cirrus vertebratus</i> is derived from Latin, meaning "jointed, articulated, vertebrated". Like cirrus intortus, the vertebratus species is exclusive to the cirrus genus. Cirrus vertebratus gives the impression of vertebrae in a spinal column, ribs, or a fish skeleton.</p><p>The species is an unusual form of cirrus clouds and is formed by air moving parallel to the main cloud line. The gaps in the cloud occur where air is descending, while the "ribs" of the cloud correspond with areas of uplift. Their occurrence appears to be connected with the location of the jet stream.</p>

It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">Stanze di Raffaello</i>, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. 
</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">Stanza della Segnatura</i> was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and <i>The School of Athens</i>, representing philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">La Disputa</i> (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the <i>Parnassus</i> (Literature). The painting is notable for its accurate perspective projection, which Raphael learned from Leonardo da Vinci (who is the central figure of this painting, representing Plato). The rebirth of Ancient Greek Philosophy and culture in Europe (along with Raphael's work) were inspired by Leonardo's individual pursuits in theatre, engineering, optics, geometry, physiology, anatomy, history, architecture and art. This work has long been seen as "Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance".</p>

As part of The Eco Everest Expedition 2011, Apa made his 21st Mount Everest summit in May 2011 then retired after a promise to his wife to stop climbing after 22 ascents. He first summited Everest in 1990 and his last time to the summit was in 2011.</p><p>Apa met Edmund Hillary many times, and was on the Expedition with his son Peter Hillary in 1990, which was the first summit for both of them. Apa estimates he has been through the Khumbu Icefall about 1000 times and almost went with Rob Hall's ill-fated 1996 expedition.</p><p>When questioned about stopping at 21, Apa stated: "Everyone says 21 is a good number. I have to make my family happy. Every time I go, they worry because Everest is very risky." He was still the joint holder of the world record of Mount Everest summits as of 2017, with Phurba Tashi and Kami Rita Sherpa, but the record was broken in 2018 by Kami Rita Sherpa.</p>
