Boggomosses range in form from small muddy swamps to elevated peat bogs or swamps, up to 150 meters across scattered among dry woodland communities, which form part of the Springsure Group of Great Artesian Basin springs. They are rich in invertebrates and form a vital chain of permanently moist oases in an otherwise dry environment.
</p><p>The origin of the term <i>boggomoss</i> is not known, but is most likely a compound of the words <i>bog</i> and <i>moss</i>. "Boggomoss creek" in the Parish of Fernyside appears on very early maps.
