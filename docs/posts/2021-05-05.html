Beverley Lodge</b>), is a historic building located in Suisun City, California, built in 1855.  It was designed by Hiram Rush.  The building served as a clubhouse and as a business.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as "Suisun Masonic Lodge No. 55".  The building has also been known locally as the <b>Stanley Beverly Lodge</b> building.
</p><p>The building is named after the Freemasons lodge that originally occupied the upper floor of the building. The lower floor was rented as retail space. The first commercial tenant of the two-storey brick building was the Moses Dinkelspiel &amp; Co. dry goods store. Over the years, a variety of businesses have come and gone from the commercial space - it has housed a pool hall, an auto parts store, and a hair salon.</p><p>Suisun Lodge no longer meets in the 623 Main St. building, having sold it in 1965 to Stanley Beverly Lodge No. 108 (a Prince Hall Affiliate Lodge).</p>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=35503105>Der Kanon</a><br><p><b>Der Kanon</b> or more precisely <b>Marcel-Reich-Ranickis Kanon</b> is a large anthology of exemplary works of German literature. Edited by the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki, he called the anthology, announced on 18 June 2001 in the German news magazine Der Spiegel under the title "The Canon of worthwhile German Works", his magnum opus. The five parts appeared from 2002 to 2006 published by Insel Verlag: 1. Novels (2002), 2. Tales/Stories (2003), 3. Dramatic Works (2004), 4. Poetry (2005), and 5. Essays (2006). As expected, the anthology met with opposition and criticism, and even the idea of an anthology was questioned, but Reich-Ranicki called this questioning "incomprehensible, because the lack of a canon would mean relapse into barbarism. Reich-Ranicki sought to differentiate his anthology from previous compilations in his hope to imagine a "reader judge" such as teachers, students, librarians, who would need to draw from this canon because they were in the "first line of those who deal with literature professionally."</p><p>The edited anthology takes the series title, <i>Der Kanon. Die deutsche Literatur</i> (The Canon of German Literature) in book form with slip cases.
