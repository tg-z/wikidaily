<p><b>Luis Alberto Edwards Vives</b> (25 November 1874 in Valparaíso – 3 April 1932 in Santiago) was a Chilean historian, nationalist politician and lawyer. He was a member of the influential Edwards family. His most famous work (highly influenced by Oswald Spengler and the German Conservative Revolution) was <i>La fronda aristocrática en Chile</i> (1928). This analyzed the history of Chile in the 19th century as a conflict between the authoritarian state and the aristocracy.</p>
