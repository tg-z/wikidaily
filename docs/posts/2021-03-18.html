<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/HXD3B_locomotive_driving_simulator.jpg/50px-HXD3B_locomotive_driving_simulator.jpg><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=621311>Train simulator</a><br><p>A <b>train simulator</b> (also <b>railroad simulator</b> or <b>railway simulator</b>) is a computer based simulation of rail transport operations. They are generally large complicated software packages modeling a 3D virtual reality world implemented both as commercial trainers, and consumer computer game software with 'play modes' which lets the user interact by stepping inside the virtual world. Because of the near view modeling, often at speed, train simulator software is generally far more complicated and difficult software to write and implement than flight simulator programs.
</p><p>While commercial trainers on mini-computer systems had a longer history, the first two mass-market English 'computer game' railway simulators, <i>Microsoft Train Simulator</i> and <i>Trainz</i>, arrived within a few months of one another in 2001 and could run on Intel 80386 microprocessor based systems. 
</p><p>Before that, already in 1996, the free BVE was aviable to the public. Later on, the Open BVE, a free and open source project, was developed and re-written from scratch.
</p><p>Some, like the first wide-market release, <i>Microsoft Train Simulator</i> (MSTS), are written and modeled for the user mainly interested in driving. Others, like MSTS's principle rival, <i>Trainz</i>, were aimed initially primarily at the rail enthusiast-hobbyist markets, supporting features making it possible to build a virtual railroad of one's dreams.  Accordingly, for four years <i>Trainz</i> releases bundled a free copy of Gmax digital model building software on each CD-ROM, hosted an asset swap website (<i>Trainz</i> Exchange, later the <i>Trainz</i> Download Station), encouraged user participation and dialog with an active forum, and took pains to publish in-depth how-to model guidelines and specifications with its releases.
</p><p>Several other later challengers as well as <i>Trainz</i> (with a series of upgrades) soon matched or eclipsed MSTS's driving experiences one way or another. <i>Railsim</i>, actually a successor using the MSTS game engine upped the challenge to the aging MSTS by adding much improved graphics, so <i>Trainz</i> did as well, but also added interactive industries and dynamic driving features such as product loading and unloading, load-sensitive physics modeling affecting driving and operating and user interface changes to improve user experience (UX), such as a free-camera mode allowing roaming away from the train cars, free and clear of the train being operated-while still controlling it. This latter makes particular sense given the dearth of an assistant on a walkie-talkie while operating a train during coupling operations or other position sensitive tasks such as loading and unloading. <i>Railsim</i> and a couple of others came and went out of business, and <i>Railsim</i> was reorganized as <i>Rail Simulator</i> with the software company that wrote MSTS as its core, while MSTS aged and never did get upgraded as Microsoft had once begun and announced. In the last few years, <i>Rail Simulator</i> has changed its name to <i>Train Simulator</i>.
</p><p>As the world market has shaken out, Australian <i>Trainz</i> in 2014-2015 upgraded itself with <i>Trainz: A New Era</i>, still servicing the wider route builder and driving markets, but now matching the 64-bit computing and graphics of <i>Train Simulator.</i> In the same five-year period, train simulators have moved to pad computer and phone platforms.</p>

The <b>Sloe Fair</b> is a travelling funfair that is held annually on 20 October at Northgate carpark in Chichester, West Sussex. The fair was first held in 1107 or 1108 after King Henry I of the Kingdom of England granted Ralph de Luffa, Bishop of Chichester, the right to hold a fair for a period of eight days from a date of de Luffa's choosing. The fair was originally chosen to coincide with the Feast of Saint Faith the Virgin on 6 October, a Gallo-Romano saint with a strong following in the area, but in 1207 a license was awarded for the fair to be held several days later, on the Vigil of the Feast of the Holy Trinity and the eight days thereafter. It is, however, unclear whether the date of the fair was actually changed, and according to records held in the library of Chichester Cathedral, as late as the 18th Century the Court of Piepowders that was held on the occasion of the fair took place between the Feast of Saint Faith and the Eve of Saint Edward the Confessor, on 12 October. The name "Sloe Fair" is believed to be a reference to a sloe tree that grew on the original site of the fair, in a field just outside Chichester's North Gate.</p><p>In its heyday, the fair attracted traders and visitors from across Southern England. Though the specific form of the event has changed over the centuries, the Sloe Fair continues to be held in the modern era. The Sloe Fair was not held during World War II and during the hostilities a caravan was placed at the site at which the fair is held, to prevent the right to hold a fair from lapsing. The modern Sloe Fair is organized by the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain and the main attractions are mechanical fairground rides. In 2009, it was reported in the local press that the Showmens' Guild's right to hold the Sloe Fair stood in the way of proposals to construct a multi-storey car park on the site of Northgate carpark, where the fair is held.</p><p>In 2020 the Sloe Fair was not held for the first time since World War 2 with the exception of a small non-operating ride due to a walk in by appointment Covid-19 test centre being put in the car park.</p><br><br>
