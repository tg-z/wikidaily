It is situated  25 kilometers north-west of Ierapetra, 40 from Agios Nikolaos and  12 kilometers away from the sea (Myrtos  village). Together with nearby hamlets Hristos and Metaxohori Males until recently formed the Nea Mala municipality. It is built 550 meters above sea level, south east  of Dikti mountain, in an area rich in vegetation. It is built  where the ancient city of Mala was.
</p><p>In the Venetian period it was the most populous village of Ierapetra. The village has many interesting churches from the Byzantine and Venetian period. The forest surrounding of Males is unique on Crete, despite the fires that have destroyed much of the ecosystem of this place in recent years. The forest Selakano is still mostly undisturbed. It is the most important forest of Crete, some 4 kilometers away in the north western part of the village.
Three kilometers from the settlement on the road to Ierapetra lies "Panagia Exacousti" monastery.
