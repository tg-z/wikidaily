<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=27439087>Quinto Romano</a><br><p><b>Quinto Romano</b> (Milanese: <i lang="lmo">Quint</i>) is a district (<i>quartiere</i>) of Milan, Italy, part of the Zone 7 administrative division of the city. Before being annexed to Milan, it was an autonomous <i>comune</i> (until 1869) and a <i>frazione</i> of Trenno (from 1869 to 1923).
</p><p>Quinto Romano was a rural district until the 1960s; the land was then partitioned into 8-9 <i>cascine</i> (farms). In the following decades, as most of the Milanese rural outskirts, Quinto experienced a quick urbanization process as a consequence of the economic boom of northern Italy and immigration from the south, which caused a quick expansion of Milan and other industrial cities. As is the case with other outskirts that have experienced this rapid development in those decades, Quinto gained the reputation of a socially and economically degraded district. 
</p><p>Quinto houses "Aquatica", the most important waterpark in Milan.
