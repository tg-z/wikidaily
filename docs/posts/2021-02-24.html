<p><i><b>Fist of Fury</b></i> (also known as <i><b>The Chinese Connection</b></i>) is a 1972 Hong Kong action martial arts film written and directed by Lo Wei, produced by Raymond Chow, and starring Bruce Lee in his second major role after <i>The Big Boss</i> (1971). Lee plays Chen Zhen, a student of Huo Yuanjia, who fights to defend the honor of the Chinese in the face of foreign aggression, and to bring to justice those responsible for his master's death.</p><p>The film was produced by the Orange Sky Golden Harvest film production company, still in its infancy at the time. Directed by Lo Wei, this was Bruce Lee's second kung fu film. The film, which touches on sensitive issues surrounding Japanese colonialism, features "realistic combat choreography". It differs from other films in the genre for its historical and social references, especially to Japanese imperialism.</p><p>The film grossed an estimated <span>US$100 million</span> worldwide (equivalent to over <span>$600 million</span> adjusted for inflation), against a budget of $100,000. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film up until Lee's <i>The Way of the Dragon</i> (1972).

Hill</a><br><p><b>Gregory Alan Hill</b> (born October 27, 1963 in Santa Ana, California) is an American former professional bicycle motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1977 to 1989. He retired from the top competitive "AA" pro circuit after the 1998 season.
</p><p>He was known to be very outspoken, a rider who had a bit of a temper on the track, and his nicknames were "The Machine" and "The Businessman", for his very serious, focused attitude toward racing even as a 14-year-old amateur, and also his willingness to speak his mind including being critical of sanctioning bodies and their policies and rules. "The Businessman" moniker in particular was coined by Bob Osborn, owner and editor of <i>Bicycle Motocross Action</i> magazine. Greg personally boycotted the ABA for almost a full season in 1980 beginning with the Winternationals and ending with the Vans 5000 Pro Spectacular. He later led an informal pro boycott with numerous respected top pros against the ABA in 1983 over the method of how the ABA national number one was decided. Hill was also involved in a number of business ventures, such as motivational and how to books and video tapes; running a short lived BMX bicycle company, Greg Hill Products (GHP) during the 1980s which he later revived in the early 1990s and is still going strong, and teaching seminars instructing children on how to race. These are but a few examples of the drive to promote himself and BMX in the public eye.
</p><p>He is the brother in law of Stu Thomsen, who married Hill's sister, Tanya, in 1979. Greg Hill's first son, Gregory Jonathan Hill, was born five hours after his father won the ESPN Pro Spectacular Series.</p><br><br>
