It was opened on July 15, 1905, after a dam had been completed near the village of Czocha. The dam was constructed between 1901 - 1905, by the government of Kingdom of Prussia’s Province of Silesia. Most workers employed during construction came from Austria and Italy, and total cost was estimated at 1,270,00 reichsmarks. The dam is 45 m high, its length is 130 m, and its thickness - 8 m on top.
</p><p>Total area of the lake is 140 hectares, and volume - 15 million cubic metres. The length of the lake is around 7 km, and it is up to 1 km wide. Between 1905 and 1907, a hydroelectric power plant was built there, for 800,000 marks, funded by the government of Silesia. Currently, it is the oldest  plant of this kind in Poland, with six J.M.Voith 1906 turbines still working. On the high, left bank of the lake, Czocha Castle is located, and on the right bank, there is the complex of Rajsko Castle. The lake is a popular summer vacation centre, with several campsites and watersports facilities.

</p>

<p>The <i>flora</i> consists of many unique varieties of tropical plants. Blessed with a tropical climate and around 17,000 islands, Indonesia is a nation with the second largest biodiversity in the world. The <b>flora of Indonesia</b> reflects an intermingling of Asian, Australian and the native species. This is due to the geography of Indonesia, located between two continents.
The archipelago consists of a variety of regions from the tropical rain forests of the northern lowlands and the seasonal forests of the southern lowlands through the hill and mountain vegetation, to subalpine shrub vegetation. Having the second longest shoreline in the world, Indonesia also has many regions of swamps and coastal vegetation. Combined together, these all give rise to a huge vegetational biodiversity.
There are about 28,000 species of flowering plants in Indonesia, consisting 2500 different kinds of orchids, 6000 traditional medicinal plants used as Jamu., 122 species of bamboo, over 350 species of rattan and 400 species of <i>Dipterocarpus</i>, including ebony, sandalwood and teakwood.
Indonesia is also home to some unusual species such as carnivorous plants. One exceptional species is known as <i>Rafflesia arnoldi</i>, named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr. Thomas Arnold, who discovered the flower in the depths of Bengkulu, southwest Sumatra. This parasitic plant has a large flower, does not produce leaves and grow on a certain liana on the rain forest floor. Another unusual plant is <i>Amorphophallus titanum</i> from Sumatra. Numerous species of insect trapping pitcher plants (<i>Nepenthes</i> spp.) can also be found in Borneo, Sumatra, and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=32349493>Explanatory combinatorial dictionary</a><br><p>An <b>explanatory combinatorial dictionary</b> (ECD) is a type of monolingual dictionary designed to be part of a meaning-text linguistic model of a natural language. It is intended to be a complete record of the lexicon of a given language.  As such, it identifies and describes, in separate entries, each of the language's lexemes (roughly speaking, each word or set of inflected forms based on a single stem) and phrasemes (roughly speaking, idioms and other multi-word fixed expressions). Among other things, each entry contains (1) a definition that incorporates a lexeme's semantic actants (for example, the definiendum of <i>give</i> takes the form <i>X gives Y to Z</i>, where its three actants are expressed —  the giver <i>X</i>, the thing given <i>Y</i>, and the person given to, <i>Z</i>) (2) complete information on lexical co-occurrence (e.g. the entry for <i>attack</i> tells you that one of its collocations is <i>launch an attack</i>, the entry for <i>party</i> provides <i>throw a party</i>, and the entry for <i>lecture</i> provides <i>deliver a lecture</i> — enabling the user to avoid making an error like *<i>deliver a party</i>); (3) an extensive set of examples. The ECD is a production dictionary — that is, it aims to provide all the information needed for a foreign learner or automaton to produce perfectly formed utterances of the language. Since the lexemes and phrasemes of a natural language number in the hundreds of thousands, a complete ECD, in paper form, would occupy the space of a large encyclopaedia. Such a work has yet to be achieved; while ECDs of Russian and French have been published, each describes less than one percent of the vocabulary of the respective languages.
</p><p>The ECD was proposed in the late 1960s by Aleksandr Žolkovskij and Igor Mel'čuk and was later further developed by Jurij Apresjan. Three ECDs are currently available in print, one for Russian, and two for French. A dictionary of Spanish collocations—DICE (= Diccionario de colocaciones del español)—is under development.</p><br><br></div></details><details><summary>2021-02-07</summary><div><img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=39337193>Stress in medical students</a><br><p><b>Stress in medical students</b> is stress caused by strenuous medical programs, which may have physical and psychological effects on the well-being of medical students. Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral symptomatology. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=8956942>POP before SMTP</a><br><p><b>POP before SMTP</b> or <b>SMTP after POP</b> is a method of authentication used by mail server software which helps allow users the option to send e-mail from any location, as long as they can demonstrably also fetch their mail from the same place.
</p><p>The POP before SMTP approach has been superseded by SMTP Authentication due to SMTP authentication being more widely used in recent years, for this and other purposes too.
</p><p>Technically, users are allowed to use SMTP from an IP address as long as they have previously made a successful login into the POP service at the same mail hosting provider, from the same address, within a predefined timeout period.
</p><p>The main advantage of this process is that it is generally transparent to the average user who will be connecting with an email client, which will almost always make a connection to fetch new mail before sending new mail. The disadvantages include a potentially complex setup for the mail hosting provider (requiring some sort of communication channel between the POP service and the SMTP service) and uncertainty as to how much time users will take to connect via SMTP (to send mail) after connecting to POP. 
</p><p>Those users not handled by this method need to resort to other authorization methods. Also, in cases where users come from externally controlled dynamically assigned addresses, the SMTP server must be careful about not giving too much leeway when allowing unauthorized connections, because of a possibility of race conditions leaving an open mail relay unintentionally exposed.

This late 19th century French-designed pottery crock has two parts: a base that holds water, and a cup to hold the packed butter which also serves as a lid. The cup containing butter is placed into the base, where water creates an airtight seal that keeps the air (and thus oxygen) away from the butter so that refrigeration is not needed, and the butter can be used in its soft form. This method will keep butter for around a month provided it is kept at temperatures below 80 °F (27 °C) and the water is changed regularly.

</p>
<p>The <b>Nigerian National Integrated Power Project</b> (NIPP) was conceived in 2004 when Olusegun Obasanjo was the President of the Federal Government of Nigeria. It was formed to address the issues of insufficient electric power generation and excessive gas flaring from oil exploration in the Niger Delta region. Seven power plants were designed in gas-producing states as part of the project.
</p><p>Planned power plants included:</p>
<ul><li>Ihovbor Power Station Benin, Edo State with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Calabar Power Station, Cross River State with the capacity of 5 x 112.5112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Egbema Power Station, Imo State with the capacity of 3 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Gbarain Power Station, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Sapele Power Station, Delta State with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Omoku Power Station, Rivers State with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Ikot Abasi Power Station, Akwa Ibom with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW) (replaced later by Ibom Power Station).</li></ul><p>Together, the projects generated contracts worth $414,000,000 for the supply of turbines and electricity generation equipment to General Electric (GE). The primary turbine is GE 9E gas turbine with a nominal ISO rating of 126MW. After adjusting for site conditions, the capacity was set to 112.5 MW.
The plants are low efficiency simple cycle but have provision for future extension to combined cycle.</p><p>Administration changes in 2007 interrupted funding for more than two years.
The NIPP project includes 11 power plants and 4 FGN Power Stations:
</p>
<ul><li>Alaoji Power Station, Abia State, combined cycle plant with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 125 MW) and 2x steam 255 MW</li>
<li>Omotosho II Power Station, Ondo State, with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 (ISO 125 MW)</li>
<li>Olorunsogo II Power Station, Ogun State, combined cycle plant with the capacity of 4 x 125 MW and 2 x steam 125 MW</li>
<li>Geregu II Power Station, Kogi State, with the capacity of 434 MW </li></ul><p>Following the Afam V and Geregu I plants, Geregu II is now the third gas-turbine power plant to be constructed by Siemens in Nigeria as a turnkey project and completed on schedule. The scope of delivery supplied by Siemens for Geregu II included three SGT5-2000E gas turbines, three SGen5-100A generators, as well as all the electrical systems and the SPPA-T3000 control system. </p><p>The Ikot Abasi NIPP power plant has been replaced by Ibom Power, which is a 190 MW project of the Akwa Ibom State Government.
The revised project involves large scale transmission projects across all of Nigeria which are crucial to ensure power distribution from generation plants to final customers.</p><br><br>

</p>
<p><b>Toddington</b> is a large village and civil parish in the county of Bedfordshire, England. It is situated 5 miles NNW of Luton, 4 miles (6 km) north of Dunstable, 6 miles (10 km) SW of Woburn, and 35 miles NNW of London on the A5120 and B579. It is 0.5 miles from Junction 12 of the M1 motorway and lends its name to the nearby motorway service station. The hamlet of Fancott also forms part of the Toddington civil parish.
</p><p>Toddington is built around a large village green, around which sit the parish church and four of the village's six public houses. The Dunstable Northern Bypass taking heavy traffic bound for Dunstable from the M1 away from the village was delayed but a restart was announced in September 2011, now due to open in 2017. A large-scale housebuilding programme has been proposed by the government for the environs of Luton, Dunstable and Milton Keynes, and proposals to build a 20,000 seat football stadium to replace Kenilworth Road were withdrawn in 2008.</p><p>Toddington has experienced a rise in house prices due to its reputation as a quiet English village and the easy commute into London.
</p><p>For local government purposes it is in the Central Bedfordshire unitary authority, and is in the Mid-Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency, represented since 5 May 2005 by Conservative MP Nadine Dorries.

He was the son of Field Marshal Michael Gallitzin and grandson of Prince Boris Kurakin. 
</p><p>In the late 1750s, Prince Gallitzin resided in Paris where he headed the Russian embassy during the Seven Years' War. His beautiful wife Catherine died there in 1761. Her liaison with actress La Clairon gained great notoriety. Catherine was the daughter of Dimitrie Cantemir, the former ruler of Moldavia, by Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya. 
</p><p>
From 1761 to 1792 he was Russian ambassador to Austria, with the poet Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay as his secretary. Catherine the Great bestowed on him the Order of St. Andrew for negotiating the First Partition of Poland with Emperor Joseph II. The prince was acclaimed for having returned to Russia the lands annexed by his patrilineal ancestor, Grand Duke Gediminas. </p>
<p>In the winter of 1782 Mozart was engaged for all the concerts given by Gallitzin who "placed his carriage at my disposal both going and returning, and treated me in the handsomest manner possible". Gallitzinberg is the hill near Vienna where the Russian ambassador built his residence (with an artificial Roman ruin and a round temple still standing). Gallitzinstraße in Vienna is also named after him. 
</p><p>The childless Prince Gallitzin, wishing to keep the memory of his wife alive for future generations, spent a fortune to establish the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow. His palace in Vienna boasted several hundred paintings by Old Masters. After his death, these paintings were exhibited in the gallery of the Golitsyn Hospital before being auctioned off in order to finance the hospital's extension.

<p><b>Boston</b> (Irish: <i lang="ga">Móinín na gCloigeann</i>, also known as <i>Druim na Doimhne</i>) is a village in north County Clare, Ireland. It is situated off R460 the Corofin to Gort regional road, at the northeastern edge of the Burren National Park, and close to the border with County Galway. The village is situated in the parish of Kilkeedy, the main settlement of which is the County Clare portion of the village of Tubber. 
</p><p>The name Boston is most likely to have been originally a nickname or ironic reference to what was described in 1839 as "a few cabins situated on the property of the Marquis of Thomond", while the Irish name, Móinín na gCloigeann ("little meadow or bog of the skulls"), appears to be a mistaken transfer from that of another place, also called Boston in English, near Cratloe in the south of the county.</p><p>The ruins of Cluain Dubháin Castle and Skaghard Castle can be found near Lough Bunny. Today, the ruins of the castle are a reminder of the past sieges endured by its previous occupants. Mahon O'Brien defended the castle for three months, before being killed by a musket ball during a siege of the castle laid by Richard Bingham in 1586.

He retired from the top competitive "AA" pro circuit after the 1998 season.
</p><p>He was known to be very outspoken, a rider who had a bit of a temper on the track, and his nicknames were "The Machine" and "The Businessman", for his very serious, focused attitude toward racing even as a 14-year-old amateur, and also his willingness to speak his mind including being critical of sanctioning bodies and their policies and rules. "The Businessman" moniker in particular was coined by Bob Osborn, owner and editor of <i>Bicycle Motocross Action</i> magazine. Greg personally boycotted the ABA for almost a full season in 1980 beginning with the Winternationals and ending with the Vans 5000 Pro Spectacular. He later led an informal pro boycott with numerous respected top pros against the ABA in 1983 over the method of how the ABA national number one was decided. Hill was also involved in a number of business ventures, such as motivational and how to books and video tapes; running a short lived BMX bicycle company, Greg Hill Products (GHP) during the 1980s which he later revived in the early 1990s and is still going strong, and teaching seminars instructing children on how to race. These are but a few examples of the drive to promote himself and BMX in the public eye.
</p><p>He is the brother in law of Stu Thomsen, who married Hill's sister, Tanya, in 1979. Greg Hill's first son, Gregory Jonathan Hill, was born five hours after his father won the ESPN Pro Spectacular Series.</p><br><br>

</p>


<p><b>Montello</b> is a hill in the province of Treviso, Veneto, northern Italy, and the site of a World War I battle.
</p><p>The bean-shaped hill measures about 5 km north-south by 13 km east-west.  It rises to a maximum of 371 m elevation from the alluvial plain of the Piave River, which runs along the north and west edges of the hill, at about 140 m elevation.
</p><p>Montello is crossed in the east-west direction by a local road that begins as Via 18 Giugno in the town of Pederiva di Biadene, continues as Strada La Dorsale and Via Frati, and ends as Via Ossario in the town of Nervesa della Battaglia. Several local roads in the general north-south direction connect this "dorsal spine" of the Montello to the two main alternative routes around the hill, either along on its southern margin (comprised by Stradone del Bosco, Via Fra Giocondo, Via Pedemontana, Via Francesco Baracca, Via Arditi, Via Armando Diaz) or along the northern margin (the Panoramic Road, comprised by Via Gabriele d'Annunzio, Via Nord Montello, Via Riviera Piave, Via Decima Armata).
</p><p>The hill gave its name to several towns nested against its base Crocetta del Montello, Montebelluna, Volpago del Montello, Giavera del Montello, and Nervesa della Battaglia.
</p><p>The hill is covered with a mix of wooded areas, residential homes, and small farms.  The church and monument of Santa Maria della Vittoria, built after the battle of 1918, is located on top of Montello, about 3.5 km north of Volpago (to which it belongs) and 5 km east from Pederiva.

It was named after the Bunyip, an Australian mythical creature.</p><p>In 1960 Crowther raced the first boat at the Easter regatta at Paynesville, Victoria, Australia, and won against a field of 300 boats. This initial success inspired others to build similar boats, and began his career.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>I knew that Lockie and his family were keen on sailing and that they had built a trimaran. As the sailing speedboat I saw that afternoon was a trimaran, I guessed, correctly, that it belonged to Lockie's family. It was not long before I'd wangled an invitation to go sailing. Their trimaran, 6 metres long, had been designed by Lockie and built out of plywood on wooden frames and stringers by him, his two brothers and their father. Maybe his sister and mother had a hand in it too; they were a close family. The tri was sloop-rigged with a wooden mast. The balanced jib was attached to a boom. The decks between the main hull and the floats were plywood. In an effort to provide lift, the floats were flat-bottomed. Although this feature was not an absolute failure, more often than not it just created extra drag. The trimaran was named Bunyip, after an Australian mythical creature. Another feature, intended to prevent broaching, was the very full bow on the main hull. This was the reason for the twin jets of water that came off the forefoot, ensuring that at any speed at all the crew became absolutely saturated. On my first outing, we were three-up; I was just a passsenger [sic]. As the wind was fairly light, the Crowthers had rigged a single-luffed spinnaker as a genoa. One of the brothers was out on a trapeze and Lockie was steering. I just sat there, thrilled by the water hosing off the bow into my face, by the rush of wind and by the streaming wake. I was hooked, but I was still a student, with no spare money at all. Building a trimaran myself was out of the question, at least for the time being.</p></blockquote><br><br>

Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.
</p><p>Attempting to tie down the Union forces in the Valley, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, Jackson received incorrect intelligence that a small detachment under Col. Nathan Kimball was vulnerable, but it was in fact a full infantry division more than twice the size of Jackson's force. His initial cavalry attack was forced back and he immediately reinforced it with a small infantry brigade. With his other two brigades, Jackson sought to envelop the Union right by way of Sandy Ridge. But Col. Erastus B. Tyler's brigade countered this movement, and, when Kimball's brigade moved to his assistance, the Confederates were driven from the field. There was no effective Union pursuit.
</p><p>Although the battle was a Confederate tactical defeat, it represented a strategic victory for the South by preventing the Union from transferring forces from the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce the Peninsula Campaign against the Confederate capital, Richmond. Following the earlier Battle of Hoke's Run, the First Battle of Kernstown may be considered the second among Jackson's rare defeats.

After branching off the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, it runs through the foramen spinosum to supply the dura mater (the outer meningeal layer) and the calvaria. The middle meningeal artery is the largest of the three (paired) arteries that supply the meninges, the others being the anterior meningeal artery and the posterior meningeal artery.
</p><p>The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery runs beneath the pterion. It is vulnerable to injury at this point, where the skull is thin. Rupture of the artery may give rise to an epidural hematoma.  In the dry cranium, the middle meningeal, which runs within the dura mater surrounding the brain, makes a deep groove in the calvarium.
</p><p>The middle meningeal artery is intimately associated with the auriculotemporal nerve, which wraps around the artery making the two easily identifiable in the dissection of human cadavers and also easily damaged in surgery.

</p>



<p>An <b>integrated circuit</b> or <b>monolithic integrated circuit</b> (also referred to as an <b>IC</b>, a <b>chip</b>, or a <b>microchip</b>) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material that is normally silicon. The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.
</p><p>Integrated circuits were made practical by technological advancements in metal–oxide–silicon (MOS) semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size – a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.
</p><p>ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to design them and fabricate the required photomasks. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated.

In 1954 it was rededicated as a memorial for the sailors of all nationalities who were lost at sea and at the same time a memorial for peaceful sailing in open seas.
</p><p>The monument consists of a 72-metre-high (236 ft) tower topped by an observation deck. The deck stands a total 85 m (279 ft) above sea level. A hall of remembrance and World War II-era German submarine <i>U-995</i>, which houses a technical museum, both sit near the foot of the monument, and the site is a popular tourist venue. <i>U-995</i> is the world's only remaining Type VII U-boat.
</p><p>The tower was designed by architect Gustav August Munzer, who stated that the form was not meant to represent anything specific but was to inspire positive feelings in those who look at it. It has been associated by some with the stem of a viking ship or the conning tower of a submarine.

</p>
<p>The <b>cinnamon-throated hermit</b> (<i>Phaethornis nattereri</i>) is a species in the hummingbird family, Trochilidae. It is found in a broad dry to semi-humid belt along the southern edge of the Amazon Rainforest from far north-eastern Bolivia north-east to Maranhão in Brazil. Its natural habitat is tropical dry to semi-humid forest, Cerrado and woodland. With its wide range, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.</p><p>There is quite some confusion about the taxonomic status of birds called <b>Maranhao hermit</b>. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the cinnamon-throated hermit, but at present most follow the analysis by Hinkelmann where it merely is considered the male plumage of <i>P. nattereri</i>. But as it seems, the Maranhao hermit only occurs in the northern part of the range of <i>P. nattereri</i>, and as the two have different voices they seem to warrant recognition as distinct species <i>P. maranhaoensis</i>. It is pending of confirmation by molecular work. When treated as a separate species, Maranhao hermit is endemic to the Brazilian states of Piauí, Maranhão, Tocantins, Pará, Mato Grosso and Goiás, where it breeds during November–April.</p><br><br></div></details>
