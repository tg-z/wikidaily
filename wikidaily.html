It was opened on July 15, 1905, after a dam had been completed near the village of Czocha. The dam was constructed between 1901 - 1905, by the government of Kingdom of Prussia’s Province of Silesia. Most workers employed during construction came from Austria and Italy, and total cost was estimated at 1,270,00 reichsmarks. The dam is 45 m high, its length is 130 m, and its thickness - 8 m on top.
</p><p>Total area of the lake is 140 hectares, and volume - 15 million cubic metres. The length of the lake is around 7 km, and it is up to 1 km wide. Between 1905 and 1907, a hydroelectric power plant was built there, for 800,000 marks, funded by the government of Silesia. Currently, it is the oldest  plant of this kind in Poland, with six J.M.Voith 1906 turbines still working. On the high, left bank of the lake, Czocha Castle is located, and on the right bank, there is the complex of Rajsko Castle. The lake is a popular summer vacation centre, with several campsites and watersports facilities.

</p>

<p>The <i>flora</i> consists of many unique varieties of tropical plants. Blessed with a tropical climate and around 17,000 islands, Indonesia is a nation with the second largest biodiversity in the world. The <b>flora of Indonesia</b> reflects an intermingling of Asian, Australian and the native species. This is due to the geography of Indonesia, located between two continents.
The archipelago consists of a variety of regions from the tropical rain forests of the northern lowlands and the seasonal forests of the southern lowlands through the hill and mountain vegetation, to subalpine shrub vegetation. Having the second longest shoreline in the world, Indonesia also has many regions of swamps and coastal vegetation. Combined together, these all give rise to a huge vegetational biodiversity.
There are about 28,000 species of flowering plants in Indonesia, consisting 2500 different kinds of orchids, 6000 traditional medicinal plants used as Jamu., 122 species of bamboo, over 350 species of rattan and 400 species of <i>Dipterocarpus</i>, including ebony, sandalwood and teakwood.
Indonesia is also home to some unusual species such as carnivorous plants. One exceptional species is known as <i>Rafflesia arnoldi</i>, named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr. Thomas Arnold, who discovered the flower in the depths of Bengkulu, southwest Sumatra. This parasitic plant has a large flower, does not produce leaves and grow on a certain liana on the rain forest floor. Another unusual plant is <i>Amorphophallus titanum</i> from Sumatra. Numerous species of insect trapping pitcher plants (<i>Nepenthes</i> spp.) can also be found in Borneo, Sumatra, and other islands of the Indonesian archipelago.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=32349493>Explanatory combinatorial dictionary</a><br><p>An <b>explanatory combinatorial dictionary</b> (ECD) is a type of monolingual dictionary designed to be part of a meaning-text linguistic model of a natural language. It is intended to be a complete record of the lexicon of a given language.  As such, it identifies and describes, in separate entries, each of the language's lexemes (roughly speaking, each word or set of inflected forms based on a single stem) and phrasemes (roughly speaking, idioms and other multi-word fixed expressions). Among other things, each entry contains (1) a definition that incorporates a lexeme's semantic actants (for example, the definiendum of <i>give</i> takes the form <i>X gives Y to Z</i>, where its three actants are expressed —  the giver <i>X</i>, the thing given <i>Y</i>, and the person given to, <i>Z</i>) (2) complete information on lexical co-occurrence (e.g. the entry for <i>attack</i> tells you that one of its collocations is <i>launch an attack</i>, the entry for <i>party</i> provides <i>throw a party</i>, and the entry for <i>lecture</i> provides <i>deliver a lecture</i> — enabling the user to avoid making an error like *<i>deliver a party</i>); (3) an extensive set of examples. The ECD is a production dictionary — that is, it aims to provide all the information needed for a foreign learner or automaton to produce perfectly formed utterances of the language. Since the lexemes and phrasemes of a natural language number in the hundreds of thousands, a complete ECD, in paper form, would occupy the space of a large encyclopaedia. Such a work has yet to be achieved; while ECDs of Russian and French have been published, each describes less than one percent of the vocabulary of the respective languages.
</p><p>The ECD was proposed in the late 1960s by Aleksandr Žolkovskij and Igor Mel'čuk and was later further developed by Jurij Apresjan. Three ECDs are currently available in print, one for Russian, and two for French. A dictionary of Spanish collocations—DICE (= Diccionario de colocaciones del español)—is under development.</p><br><br></div></details><details><summary>2021-02-07</summary><div><img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=39337193>Stress in medical students</a><br><p><b>Stress in medical students</b> is stress caused by strenuous medical programs, which may have physical and psychological effects on the well-being of medical students. Excessive stress in medical training predisposes students for difficulties in solving interpersonal conflicts as a result of previous stress. A significant percentage of medical students suffer from anxiety disorders because of the long term effects of stress on emotional and behavioral symptomatology. This condition has become a focus of concern nationally and globally, therefore the first line of detection and defense from stress are the students themselves. Students need to be given the tools to recognize and cope with stress, as well as being assured that they will not suffer judgment from others for recognizing their need for help in dealing with stress. The instructors, advisers and other faculty members who notice the signs of stress in a student need to approach the student in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way, in an effort to help medical students recognize and handle their stress.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=8956942>POP before SMTP</a><br><p><b>POP before SMTP</b> or <b>SMTP after POP</b> is a method of authentication used by mail server software which helps allow users the option to send e-mail from any location, as long as they can demonstrably also fetch their mail from the same place.
</p><p>The POP before SMTP approach has been superseded by SMTP Authentication due to SMTP authentication being more widely used in recent years, for this and other purposes too.
</p><p>Technically, users are allowed to use SMTP from an IP address as long as they have previously made a successful login into the POP service at the same mail hosting provider, from the same address, within a predefined timeout period.
</p><p>The main advantage of this process is that it is generally transparent to the average user who will be connecting with an email client, which will almost always make a connection to fetch new mail before sending new mail. The disadvantages include a potentially complex setup for the mail hosting provider (requiring some sort of communication channel between the POP service and the SMTP service) and uncertainty as to how much time users will take to connect via SMTP (to send mail) after connecting to POP. 
</p><p>Those users not handled by this method need to resort to other authorization methods. Also, in cases where users come from externally controlled dynamically assigned addresses, the SMTP server must be careful about not giving too much leeway when allowing unauthorized connections, because of a possibility of race conditions leaving an open mail relay unintentionally exposed.

This late 19th century French-designed pottery crock has two parts: a base that holds water, and a cup to hold the packed butter which also serves as a lid. The cup containing butter is placed into the base, where water creates an airtight seal that keeps the air (and thus oxygen) away from the butter so that refrigeration is not needed, and the butter can be used in its soft form. This method will keep butter for around a month provided it is kept at temperatures below 80 °F (27 °C) and the water is changed regularly.

</p>
<p>The <b>Nigerian National Integrated Power Project</b> (NIPP) was conceived in 2004 when Olusegun Obasanjo was the President of the Federal Government of Nigeria. It was formed to address the issues of insufficient electric power generation and excessive gas flaring from oil exploration in the Niger Delta region. Seven power plants were designed in gas-producing states as part of the project.
</p><p>Planned power plants included:</p>
<ul><li>Ihovbor Power Station Benin, Edo State with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Calabar Power Station, Cross River State with the capacity of 5 x 112.5112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Egbema Power Station, Imo State with the capacity of 3 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Gbarain Power Station, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Sapele Power Station, Delta State with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Omoku Power Station, Rivers State with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW).</li>
<li>Ikot Abasi Power Station, Akwa Ibom with the capacity of 2 x 112.5 MW (ISO 126 MW) (replaced later by Ibom Power Station).</li></ul><p>Together, the projects generated contracts worth $414,000,000 for the supply of turbines and electricity generation equipment to General Electric (GE). The primary turbine is GE 9E gas turbine with a nominal ISO rating of 126MW. After adjusting for site conditions, the capacity was set to 112.5 MW.
The plants are low efficiency simple cycle but have provision for future extension to combined cycle.</p><p>Administration changes in 2007 interrupted funding for more than two years.
The NIPP project includes 11 power plants and 4 FGN Power Stations:
</p>
<ul><li>Alaoji Power Station, Abia State, combined cycle plant with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 MW (ISO 125 MW) and 2x steam 255 MW</li>
<li>Omotosho II Power Station, Ondo State, with the capacity of 4 x 112.5 (ISO 125 MW)</li>
<li>Olorunsogo II Power Station, Ogun State, combined cycle plant with the capacity of 4 x 125 MW and 2 x steam 125 MW</li>
<li>Geregu II Power Station, Kogi State, with the capacity of 434 MW </li></ul><p>Following the Afam V and Geregu I plants, Geregu II is now the third gas-turbine power plant to be constructed by Siemens in Nigeria as a turnkey project and completed on schedule. The scope of delivery supplied by Siemens for Geregu II included three SGT5-2000E gas turbines, three SGen5-100A generators, as well as all the electrical systems and the SPPA-T3000 control system. </p><p>The Ikot Abasi NIPP power plant has been replaced by Ibom Power, which is a 190 MW project of the Akwa Ibom State Government.
The revised project involves large scale transmission projects across all of Nigeria which are crucial to ensure power distribution from generation plants to final customers.</p><br><br>

</p>
<p><b>Toddington</b> is a large village and civil parish in the county of Bedfordshire, England. It is situated 5 miles NNW of Luton, 4 miles (6 km) north of Dunstable, 6 miles (10 km) SW of Woburn, and 35 miles NNW of London on the A5120 and B579. It is 0.5 miles from Junction 12 of the M1 motorway and lends its name to the nearby motorway service station. The hamlet of Fancott also forms part of the Toddington civil parish.
</p><p>Toddington is built around a large village green, around which sit the parish church and four of the village's six public houses. The Dunstable Northern Bypass taking heavy traffic bound for Dunstable from the M1 away from the village was delayed but a restart was announced in September 2011, now due to open in 2017. A large-scale housebuilding programme has been proposed by the government for the environs of Luton, Dunstable and Milton Keynes, and proposals to build a 20,000 seat football stadium to replace Kenilworth Road were withdrawn in 2008.</p><p>Toddington has experienced a rise in house prices due to its reputation as a quiet English village and the easy commute into London.
</p><p>For local government purposes it is in the Central Bedfordshire unitary authority, and is in the Mid-Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency, represented since 5 May 2005 by Conservative MP Nadine Dorries.

He was the son of Field Marshal Michael Gallitzin and grandson of Prince Boris Kurakin. 
</p><p>In the late 1750s, Prince Gallitzin resided in Paris where he headed the Russian embassy during the Seven Years' War. His beautiful wife Catherine died there in 1761. Her liaison with actress La Clairon gained great notoriety. Catherine was the daughter of Dimitrie Cantemir, the former ruler of Moldavia, by Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya. 
</p><p>
From 1761 to 1792 he was Russian ambassador to Austria, with the poet Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay as his secretary. Catherine the Great bestowed on him the Order of St. Andrew for negotiating the First Partition of Poland with Emperor Joseph II. The prince was acclaimed for having returned to Russia the lands annexed by his patrilineal ancestor, Grand Duke Gediminas. </p>
<p>In the winter of 1782 Mozart was engaged for all the concerts given by Gallitzin who "placed his carriage at my disposal both going and returning, and treated me in the handsomest manner possible". Gallitzinberg is the hill near Vienna where the Russian ambassador built his residence (with an artificial Roman ruin and a round temple still standing). Gallitzinstraße in Vienna is also named after him. 
</p><p>The childless Prince Gallitzin, wishing to keep the memory of his wife alive for future generations, spent a fortune to establish the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow. His palace in Vienna boasted several hundred paintings by Old Masters. After his death, these paintings were exhibited in the gallery of the Golitsyn Hospital before being auctioned off in order to finance the hospital's extension.

<p><b>Boston</b> (Irish: <i lang="ga">Móinín na gCloigeann</i>, also known as <i>Druim na Doimhne</i>) is a village in north County Clare, Ireland. It is situated off R460 the Corofin to Gort regional road, at the northeastern edge of the Burren National Park, and close to the border with County Galway. The village is situated in the parish of Kilkeedy, the main settlement of which is the County Clare portion of the village of Tubber. 
</p><p>The name Boston is most likely to have been originally a nickname or ironic reference to what was described in 1839 as "a few cabins situated on the property of the Marquis of Thomond", while the Irish name, Móinín na gCloigeann ("little meadow or bog of the skulls"), appears to be a mistaken transfer from that of another place, also called Boston in English, near Cratloe in the south of the county.</p><p>The ruins of Cluain Dubháin Castle and Skaghard Castle can be found near Lough Bunny. Today, the ruins of the castle are a reminder of the past sieges endured by its previous occupants. Mahon O'Brien defended the castle for three months, before being killed by a musket ball during a siege of the castle laid by Richard Bingham in 1586.

He retired from the top competitive "AA" pro circuit after the 1998 season.
</p><p>He was known to be very outspoken, a rider who had a bit of a temper on the track, and his nicknames were "The Machine" and "The Businessman", for his very serious, focused attitude toward racing even as a 14-year-old amateur, and also his willingness to speak his mind including being critical of sanctioning bodies and their policies and rules. "The Businessman" moniker in particular was coined by Bob Osborn, owner and editor of <i>Bicycle Motocross Action</i> magazine. Greg personally boycotted the ABA for almost a full season in 1980 beginning with the Winternationals and ending with the Vans 5000 Pro Spectacular. He later led an informal pro boycott with numerous respected top pros against the ABA in 1983 over the method of how the ABA national number one was decided. Hill was also involved in a number of business ventures, such as motivational and how to books and video tapes; running a short lived BMX bicycle company, Greg Hill Products (GHP) during the 1980s which he later revived in the early 1990s and is still going strong, and teaching seminars instructing children on how to race. These are but a few examples of the drive to promote himself and BMX in the public eye.
</p><p>He is the brother in law of Stu Thomsen, who married Hill's sister, Tanya, in 1979. Greg Hill's first son, Gregory Jonathan Hill, was born five hours after his father won the ESPN Pro Spectacular Series.</p><br><br>

</p>


<p><b>Montello</b> is a hill in the province of Treviso, Veneto, northern Italy, and the site of a World War I battle.
</p><p>The bean-shaped hill measures about 5 km north-south by 13 km east-west.  It rises to a maximum of 371 m elevation from the alluvial plain of the Piave River, which runs along the north and west edges of the hill, at about 140 m elevation.
</p><p>Montello is crossed in the east-west direction by a local road that begins as Via 18 Giugno in the town of Pederiva di Biadene, continues as Strada La Dorsale and Via Frati, and ends as Via Ossario in the town of Nervesa della Battaglia. Several local roads in the general north-south direction connect this "dorsal spine" of the Montello to the two main alternative routes around the hill, either along on its southern margin (comprised by Stradone del Bosco, Via Fra Giocondo, Via Pedemontana, Via Francesco Baracca, Via Arditi, Via Armando Diaz) or along the northern margin (the Panoramic Road, comprised by Via Gabriele d'Annunzio, Via Nord Montello, Via Riviera Piave, Via Decima Armata).
</p><p>The hill gave its name to several towns nested against its base Crocetta del Montello, Montebelluna, Volpago del Montello, Giavera del Montello, and Nervesa della Battaglia.
</p><p>The hill is covered with a mix of wooded areas, residential homes, and small farms.  The church and monument of Santa Maria della Vittoria, built after the battle of 1918, is located on top of Montello, about 3.5 km north of Volpago (to which it belongs) and 5 km east from Pederiva.

It was named after the Bunyip, an Australian mythical creature.</p><p>In 1960 Crowther raced the first boat at the Easter regatta at Paynesville, Victoria, Australia, and won against a field of 300 boats. This initial success inspired others to build similar boats, and began his career.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote"><p>I knew that Lockie and his family were keen on sailing and that they had built a trimaran. As the sailing speedboat I saw that afternoon was a trimaran, I guessed, correctly, that it belonged to Lockie's family. It was not long before I'd wangled an invitation to go sailing. Their trimaran, 6 metres long, had been designed by Lockie and built out of plywood on wooden frames and stringers by him, his two brothers and their father. Maybe his sister and mother had a hand in it too; they were a close family. The tri was sloop-rigged with a wooden mast. The balanced jib was attached to a boom. The decks between the main hull and the floats were plywood. In an effort to provide lift, the floats were flat-bottomed. Although this feature was not an absolute failure, more often than not it just created extra drag. The trimaran was named Bunyip, after an Australian mythical creature. Another feature, intended to prevent broaching, was the very full bow on the main hull. This was the reason for the twin jets of water that came off the forefoot, ensuring that at any speed at all the crew became absolutely saturated. On my first outing, we were three-up; I was just a passsenger [sic]. As the wind was fairly light, the Crowthers had rigged a single-luffed spinnaker as a genoa. One of the brothers was out on a trapeze and Lockie was steering. I just sat there, thrilled by the water hosing off the bow into my face, by the rush of wind and by the streaming wake. I was hooked, but I was still a student, with no spare money at all. Building a trimaran myself was out of the question, at least for the time being.</p></blockquote><br><br>

Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.
</p><p>Attempting to tie down the Union forces in the Valley, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, Jackson received incorrect intelligence that a small detachment under Col. Nathan Kimball was vulnerable, but it was in fact a full infantry division more than twice the size of Jackson's force. His initial cavalry attack was forced back and he immediately reinforced it with a small infantry brigade. With his other two brigades, Jackson sought to envelop the Union right by way of Sandy Ridge. But Col. Erastus B. Tyler's brigade countered this movement, and, when Kimball's brigade moved to his assistance, the Confederates were driven from the field. There was no effective Union pursuit.
</p><p>Although the battle was a Confederate tactical defeat, it represented a strategic victory for the South by preventing the Union from transferring forces from the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce the Peninsula Campaign against the Confederate capital, Richmond. Following the earlier Battle of Hoke's Run, the First Battle of Kernstown may be considered the second among Jackson's rare defeats.

After branching off the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, it runs through the foramen spinosum to supply the dura mater (the outer meningeal layer) and the calvaria. The middle meningeal artery is the largest of the three (paired) arteries that supply the meninges, the others being the anterior meningeal artery and the posterior meningeal artery.
</p><p>The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery runs beneath the pterion. It is vulnerable to injury at this point, where the skull is thin. Rupture of the artery may give rise to an epidural hematoma.  In the dry cranium, the middle meningeal, which runs within the dura mater surrounding the brain, makes a deep groove in the calvarium.
</p><p>The middle meningeal artery is intimately associated with the auriculotemporal nerve, which wraps around the artery making the two easily identifiable in the dissection of human cadavers and also easily damaged in surgery.

</p>



<p>An <b>integrated circuit</b> or <b>monolithic integrated circuit</b> (also referred to as an <b>IC</b>, a <b>chip</b>, or a <b>microchip</b>) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material that is normally silicon. The integration of large numbers of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.
</p><p>Integrated circuits were made practical by technological advancements in metal–oxide–silicon (MOS) semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more MOS transistors on chips of the same size – a modern chip may have many billions of MOS transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.
</p><p>ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to design them and fabricate the required photomasks. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated.

In 1954 it was rededicated as a memorial for the sailors of all nationalities who were lost at sea and at the same time a memorial for peaceful sailing in open seas.
</p><p>The monument consists of a 72-metre-high (236 ft) tower topped by an observation deck. The deck stands a total 85 m (279 ft) above sea level. A hall of remembrance and World War II-era German submarine <i>U-995</i>, which houses a technical museum, both sit near the foot of the monument, and the site is a popular tourist venue. <i>U-995</i> is the world's only remaining Type VII U-boat.
</p><p>The tower was designed by architect Gustav August Munzer, who stated that the form was not meant to represent anything specific but was to inspire positive feelings in those who look at it. It has been associated by some with the stem of a viking ship or the conning tower of a submarine.

</p>
<p>The <b>cinnamon-throated hermit</b> (<i>Phaethornis nattereri</i>) is a species in the hummingbird family, Trochilidae. It is found in a broad dry to semi-humid belt along the southern edge of the Amazon Rainforest from far north-eastern Bolivia north-east to Maranhão in Brazil. Its natural habitat is tropical dry to semi-humid forest, Cerrado and woodland. With its wide range, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.</p><p>There is quite some confusion about the taxonomic status of birds called <b>Maranhao hermit</b>. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the cinnamon-throated hermit, but at present most follow the analysis by Hinkelmann where it merely is considered the male plumage of <i>P. nattereri</i>. But as it seems, the Maranhao hermit only occurs in the northern part of the range of <i>P. nattereri</i>, and as the two have different voices they seem to warrant recognition as distinct species <i>P. maranhaoensis</i>. It is pending of confirmation by molecular work. When treated as a separate species, Maranhao hermit is endemic to the Brazilian states of Piauí, Maranhão, Tocantins, Pará, Mato Grosso and Goiás, where it breeds during November–April.</p><br><br></div></details><details><summary>2021-03-16</summary><div><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Bonita_1996.jpg/50px-Bonita_1996.jpg><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=41182346>Cyclone Bonita</a><br><p class="mw-empty-elt">
</p>
<p><b>Intense Tropical Cyclone Bonita</b> in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from Météo-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and Réunion to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations.
</p><p>Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm, though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zambia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean.

They are generally large complicated software packages modeling a 3D virtual reality world implemented both as commercial trainers, and consumer computer game software with 'play modes' which lets the user interact by stepping inside the virtual world. Because of the near view modeling, often at speed, train simulator software is generally far more complicated and difficult software to write and implement than flight simulator programs.
</p><p>While commercial trainers on mini-computer systems had a longer history, the first two mass-market English 'computer game' railway simulators, <i>Microsoft Train Simulator</i> and <i>Trainz</i>, arrived within a few months of one another in 2001 and could run on Intel 80386 microprocessor based systems. 
</p><p>Before that, already in 1996, the free BVE was aviable to the public. Later on, the Open BVE, a free and open source project, was developed and re-written from scratch.
</p><p>Some, like the first wide-market release, <i>Microsoft Train Simulator</i> (MSTS), are written and modeled for the user mainly interested in driving. Others, like MSTS's principle rival, <i>Trainz</i>, were aimed initially primarily at the rail enthusiast-hobbyist markets, supporting features making it possible to build a virtual railroad of one's dreams.  Accordingly, for four years <i>Trainz</i> releases bundled a free copy of Gmax digital model building software on each CD-ROM, hosted an asset swap website (<i>Trainz</i> Exchange, later the <i>Trainz</i> Download Station), encouraged user participation and dialog with an active forum, and took pains to publish in-depth how-to model guidelines and specifications with its releases.
</p><p>Several other later challengers as well as <i>Trainz</i> (with a series of upgrades) soon matched or eclipsed MSTS's driving experiences one way or another. <i>Railsim</i>, actually a successor using the MSTS game engine upped the challenge to the aging MSTS by adding much improved graphics, so <i>Trainz</i> did as well, but also added interactive industries and dynamic driving features such as product loading and unloading, load-sensitive physics modeling affecting driving and operating and user interface changes to improve user experience (UX), such as a free-camera mode allowing roaming away from the train cars, free and clear of the train being operated-while still controlling it. This latter makes particular sense given the dearth of an assistant on a walkie-talkie while operating a train during coupling operations or other position sensitive tasks such as loading and unloading. <i>Railsim</i> and a couple of others came and went out of business, and <i>Railsim</i> was reorganized as <i>Rail Simulator</i> with the software company that wrote MSTS as its core, while MSTS aged and never did get upgraded as Microsoft had once begun and announced. In the last few years, <i>Rail Simulator</i> has changed its name to <i>Train Simulator</i>.
</p><p>As the world market has shaken out, Australian <i>Trainz</i> in 2014-2015 upgraded itself with <i>Trainz: A New Era</i>, still servicing the wider route builder and driving markets, but now matching the 64-bit computing and graphics of <i>Train Simulator.</i> In the same five-year period, train simulators have moved to pad computer and phone platforms.</p>

The fair was first held in 1107 or 1108 after King Henry I of the Kingdom of England granted Ralph de Luffa, Bishop of Chichester, the right to hold a fair for a period of eight days from a date of de Luffa's choosing. The fair was originally chosen to coincide with the Feast of Saint Faith the Virgin on 6 October, a Gallo-Romano saint with a strong following in the area, but in 1207 a license was awarded for the fair to be held several days later, on the Vigil of the Feast of the Holy Trinity and the eight days thereafter. It is, however, unclear whether the date of the fair was actually changed, and according to records held in the library of Chichester Cathedral, as late as the 18th Century the Court of Piepowders that was held on the occasion of the fair took place between the Feast of Saint Faith and the Eve of Saint Edward the Confessor, on 12 October. The name "Sloe Fair" is believed to be a reference to a sloe tree that grew on the original site of the fair, in a field just outside Chichester's North Gate.</p><p>In its heyday, the fair attracted traders and visitors from across Southern England. Though the specific form of the event has changed over the centuries, the Sloe Fair continues to be held in the modern era. The Sloe Fair was not held during World War II and during the hostilities a caravan was placed at the site at which the fair is held, to prevent the right to hold a fair from lapsing. The modern Sloe Fair is organized by the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain and the main attractions are mechanical fairground rides. In 2009, it was reported in the local press that the Showmens' Guild's right to hold the Sloe Fair stood in the way of proposals to construct a multi-storey car park on the site of Northgate carpark, where the fair is held.</p><p>In 2020 the Sloe Fair was not held for the first time since World War 2 with the exception of a small non-operating ride due to a walk in by appointment Covid-19 test centre being put in the car park.</p><br><br>

He was canonized by Pope John Paul II on 21 May 2000 as one of 25 Martyrs of the Cristero War.
</p><p>David Galván was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, son of José Trinidad Galván and Mariana Bermúdez. The latter would die when his son was three years old. Later, his father remarried and David was taken care of by his father, sisters, and stepmother Victoriana Medina. From a young age he had to help his father in the shoe shop.
</p><p>When he was fourteen, he entered the Saint Joseph of Guadalajara Seminary to attend high school, but he would leave in 1900 to return to work in the shoe shop. He would then ask for readmission two years later. Due to his low fidelity, the General Prefect Miguel de la Mora subjected him to rigorous tests for a year. But it was clear that David's personality had pacified and surprised his examiners by his dedication to mental prayer and his perseverance in enduring adversity.
</p><p>Finally, he was ordained on May 20, 1909 when he was 28 years old and, shortly thereafter, he was confirmed as superior of the same seminary. From his beginnings as a priest, he was characterized by helping the poor. Among the many positions he held within the seminary, he was a teacher of the diocesan seminary, being the chair for Latin, natural law, and sociology. He was also the founder and director of the seminary magazine "Voice of Breath", from December 1910 to 1912. In those same years, from 1909 to 1914, he was the chaplain of the Hospital of San José and the Orphanage of La Luz in Guadalajara. However, his work within the seminary was interrupted when the Archbishop of Guadalajara, Francisco Orozco y Jiménez, dissolved it following the arrest of 120 clerics.
</p><p>In 1914, while he was vicar of Amátitán, he helped a young girl who was persecuted by the militant Enrique Vera for denying him marriage because she was already married. This brought Father Galván the enmity of the lieutenant, who became his executioner. He was apprehended by orders of the aforementioned captain. The arrest lacked substance, which led to Father Galván regaining his freedom.
</p><p>On the Saturday of 30 January 1915, violent clashes between host Villistas and Carrancistas were recorded in Guadalajara. The priests David Galván and José María Araiza prepared to help the dying and wounded. When they crossed the botanical garden, in front of the old San Miguel Hospital, they were intercepted by Enrique Vera, who ordered his immediate arrest and without prior trial, sentenced him to the death penalty. A timely pardon saved Father Araiza's life but Galván would not suffer the same fate, as he was sent to Coronel Calderón Street, next to the Belén Cemetery. In front of the firing squad and without losing the fortitude, Father Galván distributed the valuables he carried. He did not want to be blindfolded and in front of those responsible for executing it, he pointed calmly at his chest to receive the bullets.

</p>
<p><i><b>Duke Nukem Forever</b></i> is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and published by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the fifth installment in the <i>Duke Nukem</i> series and the sequel to 1996's <i>Duke Nukem 3D</i>. <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> entered development in 1997 at 3D Realms and was finished by Triptych Games, Gearbox Software, and Piranha Games between 2009 and 2011. In the game, the player controls Duke Nukem, an action hero who must come out of retirement and save the world from aliens when they begin kidnapping the women of Earth.
</p><p><i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> was originally announced in 1997 as the follow up to <i>Duke Nukem 3D</i>, but was thought to be vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule, which saw the game being delayed numerous times and had 3D Realms, which was being underfunded and laying off staff in 2009, become involved in a lawsuit with publisher Take-Two Interactive. In 2010, Gearbox took over the game's development and finished the game on behalf of 3D Realms. Finally released on June 14, 2011, <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> earned mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the graphics, dated humor and story, simplistic mechanics, and unpolished performance and design.

It is faintly visible to the naked eye, having a combined apparent visual magnitude of +5.60.

The system is deemed to be a member of the Sirius supercluster of stars that share a common motion through space.</p><p>The primary, component A, is a white-hued A-type subgiant star with a stellar classification of A4 IV. It is a microvariable, showing a 0.0056 change in magnitude with a frequency of 0.16245 times per day. Epsilon Pyxidis has been catalogued as an Am star, although this remains uncertain. It has double the mass of the Sun and radiates 19 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,368 K.</p><p>In addition to a close companion of unknown type at an angular separation of 0.17 arc seconds, the primary shares an orbit with a binary star system, components B and C, that lie at an angular separation of 17.8 arc seconds. At the estimated distance of this system, this corresponds to a projected separation of around 1,150 AU. The B/C pair consist of visual magnitude 10.5 and 10.8 stars with a mean separation of 0.3 arc seconds. They have estimated mass of 90% and 95% that of the Sun, respectively.</p>

Although there isn't a show with the same title, the CD has twenty-five of Forbidden Broadway's best songs, including eight previously unreleased tracks. It was conceived, created and written (parody lyrics) by Gerard Alessandrini.
</p><p>The CD bears the label "The Ultimate Unreleased Un-Original Cast Recording," pointing out that this does not exclusively feature the original cast.  The liner notes give a retrospective of Forbidden Broadway's beginnings, as well as a gallery of photos of the original cast with the stars they mock so lovingly.
</p><p>This CD returns the parodies of such shows as <i>Ragtime</i>, <i>Annie</i>, <i>Into the Woods</i>, <i>Cats</i>, <i>Martin Guerre</i>, and <i>Les Misérables</i>. Stars like Julie Andrews, Mandy Patinkin, and Patti Lupone also share the ridicule.

It has a diameter of 475 km (295 mi), a height of 1.75 km (1.09 mi), and is located in Venus' northern hemisphere.  More specifically, it is located in the central Eistla Regio region at (<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r994658806"><span><span><span title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span>14°0′N</span> <span>16°0′E</span></span></span></span>) in the V-20 quadrangle.  Sappho Patera, a 225 km (140 mi) diameter wide, caldera-like, depression tops the summit of Irnini Mons.  The primary structural features surrounding Irnini Mons are graben, seen as linear depressed sections of rock, radiating from the central magma chamber.  Also, concentric, circular ridges and graben outline the Sappho Patera depression at the summit.  The volcano is crossed by various rift zones, including the north-south trending Badb Linea rift, the Guor Linea rift extending to the northwest, and the Virtus Linea rift continuing to the southeast.</p><p>The combination of volcanic-tectonic structures around Irnini Mons supports varying intensities of deformation and a multi-directional stress history. Although classified as a shield volcano, Irnini Mons contains many elements of the Venusian coronae, bringing speculation to its formation.  If Irnini Mons was originally a corona, a shallow oval-shaped depression, it would support a thin lithosphere on Venus.  On the other hand, it being a shield volcano supports the theory of a thicker lithosphere and Irnini Mons' stress history  could be summarized simply as a transition from predominantly compressive forces to extensional relaxation, resulting in the observed radiating graben and concentric ridges.</p><p>Irnini Mons is a significant structural feature on Venus because the preservation of the geology allows for the analysis of Venus' regional stress orientation in response to a pressurized magma chamber over time.</p>

Its vertex coordinates (labels) are the permutations of the first <i>n</i> natural numbers. The edges identify the shortest possible paths (sets of transpositions) that connect two vertices (permutations). Two permutations connected by an edge differ in only two places (one transposition), and the numbers on these places are neighbors (differ in value by 1).
</p><p>The image on the right shows the permutohedron of order 4, which is the truncated octahedron. Its vertices are the 24 permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4). Parallel edges have the same edge color. The 6 edge colors correspond to the 6 possible transpositions of 4 elements, i.e. they indicate in which two places the connected permutations differ. (E.g. red edges connect permutations that differ in the last two places.)

It is the end station of line 10 and line 11 and was opened on 30 October 1977, as the 91st station and part of the one-station extension from T-Centralen. The platform is located approximately 34 meters underground. The station features relics rescued from the many buildings pulled down during the redevelopment of central Stockholm during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the station.</p>

<p>The entrance to the station was originally intended to be in the park Kungsträdgården, but due to the Elm Conflict in 1971 these plans had to change.

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9654206>Smile (Lyle Lovett album)</a><br><p><i><b>Smile</b></i> is a 2003 compilation of songs performed by Lyle Lovett for various movie soundtracks between 1992 and 2002.   <i>Smile</i> was the fifth project by Lovett that did <i>not</i> introduce a new collection of his own songs during the expanse of time between his 1996 Grammy winning <i>The Road to Ensenada</i> and <i>My Baby Don't Tolerate</i> (released later in 2003).  Other projects included a 1998 cover album, a 1999 live album, a 2000 movie soundtrack, and a 2001 anthology.  The release of <i>Smile</i> led some reviewers to speculate the Lovett might be experiencing some sort of writer's block.  Another possibility is that Lovett was taking it easy following a 2002 injury from an accident involving a bull on a family farm in Texas.  During the incident Lovett's leg was broken in 20 places.  A fracture to his thumb also left him unable to play guitar for an extended period.</p><p>The album has been described as a "nice listen" and "nice for collectors" to find all of these songs together, but "not essential,"  and "uneven." </p>

The bill authorizes $956 billion in spending over the next ten years.</p><p>The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives on January 29, 2014, and the United States Senate on February 4, 2014 during the 113th United States Congress. U.S. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on February 7, 2014. The bill is considered two years late, since farm bills are traditionally passed every five years.

</p>
<p><b>Carol Kaye</b> (<i>nee</i> <b>Smith</b>, born March 24, 1935) is an American musician. She is one of the most prolific recorded bass guitarists in rock and pop music, playing on an estimated 10,000 recordings in a career spanning over 50 years.</p><p>Kaye began playing guitar in her early teens and after some time as a guitar teacher, began to perform regularly on the Los Angeles jazz and big band circuit. She started session work in 1957, and through a connection at Gold Star Studios began working for producers Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. After a bassist failed to turn up to a session in 1963, she switched to that instrument, quickly making a name for herself as one of the most in-demand session players of the 1960s, playing on numerous hits. She moved into playing on film soundtracks in the late 1960s, particularly for Quincy Jones and Lalo Schifrin, and began to release a series of tutoring books such as <i>How To Play The Electric Bass</i>. Kaye became less active towards the end of the 1970s, but has continued her career and attracted praise from other musicians.
</p><p>During the peak of her years of session work, she became part of a stable of Los Angeles-based musicians which went by a variety of informal names, but has since become known as "The Wrecking Crew".  Her work with the group led to her prominent role in the 2008 documentary film titled <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>.

A graduate of Harvard College, he also played a notable role in the 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game, in which Harvard roared back from a 29–13 deficit in the final 42 seconds of play to tie Yale, 29–29. Both teams were undefeated at the time.
</p><p>Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Varney attended North Quincy High School and Deerfield Academy before enrolling at Harvard, where he played varsity football as well as baseball. In the 85th Harvard–Yale game on November 23, 1968, tight end Varney caught Frank Champi's pass for the two-point conversion in the final second to earn a tie, and a share of the Ivy League championship, with Yale.  Although the famous game ended deadlocked, the furious comeback caused <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> to headline its game story, <i>Harvard Beats Yale 29-29</i>.  A standout in baseball, Varney batted .370 over his three varsity seasons, still the third-highest batting average in Crimson baseball history, and was selected a first-team All-American.</p><p>After being drafted six previous times by five different Major League Baseball teams, Varney signed with the Chicago White Sox after they selected him in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft following his graduation from Harvard. The 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 235 lb (107 kg) catcher began his professional career at the Double-A level of minor league baseball and made his Major League debut late in 1973, appearing in five games played and going hitless in four at bats. In his most successful season, 1975, Varney appeared in 36 games as the backup to regular ChiSox catcher Brian Downing, batting .271 in 107 at bats.
</p><p>In 1976, Varney played sporadically for the White Sox during the season's first ten weeks, logging 43 plate appearances with ten hits and two bases on balls, but he did hit three of his five career MLB home runs during that stretch. On July 15, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for pitcher Blue Moon Odom. He spent much of the rest of that season with the Triple-A Richmond Braves, coming to bat for Atlanta ten times, with one hit, a single.
</p><p>All told, in 69 MLB games played, Varney batted .247, with seven doubles and one triple, along with his five homers.
</p><p>Pete Varney retired from professional baseball after the 1977 minor league season. After three years of high school coaching in Templeton, Massachusetts, he became head baseball coach at Brandeis University.  In 34 years as head coach of the Brandeis Judges he compiled a win-loss record of 705–528 (with six ties), and became the winningest Brandeis coach in any varsity sport.  From 1988 to 1990, he skippered the Cotuit Kettleers, a collegiate summer baseball team in the Cape Cod Baseball League. He announced his retirement effective June 30, 2015.</p>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=24298124>Derailment (thought disorder)</a><br><p>In psychiatry, <b>derailment</b> (also <b>loosening of association</b>, <b>asyndesis</b>, <b>asyndetic thinking</b>, <b>knight's move thinking</b>, or <b>entgleisen</b>) is a thought disorder characterized by discourse consisting of a sequence of unrelated or only remotely related ideas. The frame of reference often changes from one sentence to the next.</p><p>In a mild manifestation, this thought disorder is characterized by slippage of ideas further and further from the point of a discussion. Derailment can often be manifestly caused by intense emotions such as euphoria or hysteria. Some of the synonyms given above (<i>loosening of association</i>, <i>asyndetic thinking</i>) are used by some authors to refer just to a <i>loss of goal</i>: discourse that sets off on a particular idea, wanders off and never returns to it. A related term is tangentiality—it refers to off-the-point, oblique or irrelevant answers given to questions. In some studies on creativity, <i>knight's move thinking</i>, while it describes a similarly loose association of ideas, is not considered a mental disorder or the hallmark of one; it is sometimes used as a synonym for lateral thinking.</p>

It is a measure of well-being assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, self-concepts, and self-perceived ability to cope with one's daily life. Life satisfaction involves a favorable attitude towards one's life rather than an assessment of current feelings. Life satisfaction has been measured in relation to economic standing, degree of education, experiences, residence, among many other topics.</p><p>Life satisfaction is a key part of subjective wellbeing. There are many factors both internal and external that contribute to one's subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction. (Diener, 2021).

R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). The large number of packages available for R, and the ease of installing and using them, has been cited as a major factor in driving the widespread adoption of the language in data science.</p><p>Compared to libraries in other programming language, R packages must conform to a relatively strict specification. The <i>Writing R Extensions</i> manual specifies a standard directory structure for R source code, data, documentation, and package metadata, which enables them to be installed and loaded using R's in-built package management tools. Packages distributed on CRAN must meet additional standards. According to John Chambers, whilst these requirements "impose considerable demands" on package developers, they improve the usability and long-term stability of packages for end users.</p>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=94057>Tetris Attack</a><br><p class="mw-empty-elt">
</p>

<p><i><b>Tetris Attack</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Panel de Pon</b></i>, is a 1995 puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A Game Boy version was released a year later. In the game, the player must arrange matching colored blocks in vertical or horizontal rows to clear them. The blocks steadily rise towards the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. Several gameplay modes are present, including a time attack and multiplayer mode.
</p><p>Produced by Gunpei Yokoi, <i>Tetris Attack</i> was released as <i>Panel de Pon</i> in Japan, featuring fairies as the main characters with a mythical, fantasy setting. International versions instead replace these with characters and settings from <i>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</i>. Though international releases have the name <i>Tetris Attack</i>, the game bears no relation to the <i>Tetris</i> video game series, leading Tetris Company co-founder Henk Rogers to regret giving Nintendo the license to use the name. Both <i>Panel de Pon</i> and <i>Tetris Attack</i> were later broadcast through the Japan-only Satellaview peripheral, the latter renamed to <i>BS Yoshi's Panepon</i>.
</p><p><i>Tetris Attack</i> was well-received by critics for its graphical style, addictive gameplay and multiplayer modes, with some noting the North American version was superior to the original Japanese release. It was followed by a series of sequels and remakes for multiple platforms, most of which instead use the name <i>Puzzle League</i>. The game is referenced in other Nintendo games, such as the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> series, <i>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</i>, and <i>Captain Rainbow</i>.

</p>
<p>The <b>2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa</b> is an international rugby union tour that is scheduled to take place in South Africa in 2021.</p><p>The British &amp; Irish Lions are scheduled to play a three-match test series against South Africa. Unlike previous series, where the Lions played seven additional games against local teams, in 2021 there will only be five additional games, making a total of eight.</p><p>Possible candidates to coach the 2021 Lions included Warren Gatland, Eddie Jones, Gregor Townsend, Joe Schmidt, Dai Young and Mark McCall. Subsequently, in May 2019, Warren Gatland agreed to take charge of the team for the third successive time, with both parties agreeing to the deal. Gatland was officially unveiled as the 2021 coach on 12 June 2019.</p><p>Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports started emerging in early 2021 that the tour could be held in the British Isles instead of South Africa, postponed to 2022 or cancelled altogether.</p><p>With the Lions traditionally being a touring side only, many fans opposed the move with thousands signing a petition to put pressure on the Lions board to keep the tour in South Africa and postpone till 2022. 1997 Lions tourist, Tim Stimpson put his backing behind the campaign.</p><p>In January 2021, Rugby Australia offered to host the tournament in Australia if it could not be held in South Africa. This offer has been rejected.</p><p>In March 2021 it was confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned.</p>

The name <i>cirrus vertebratus</i> is derived from Latin, meaning "jointed, articulated, vertebrated". Like cirrus intortus, the vertebratus species is exclusive to the cirrus genus. Cirrus vertebratus gives the impression of vertebrae in a spinal column, ribs, or a fish skeleton.</p><p>The species is an unusual form of cirrus clouds and is formed by air moving parallel to the main cloud line. The gaps in the cloud occur where air is descending, while the "ribs" of the cloud correspond with areas of uplift. Their occurrence appears to be connected with the location of the jet stream.</p>

It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">Stanze di Raffaello</i>, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. 
</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">Stanza della Segnatura</i> was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and <i>The School of Athens</i>, representing philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after <i lang="it" title="Italian-language text">La Disputa</i> (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the <i>Parnassus</i> (Literature). The painting is notable for its accurate perspective projection, which Raphael learned from Leonardo da Vinci (who is the central figure of this painting, representing Plato). The rebirth of Ancient Greek Philosophy and culture in Europe (along with Raphael's work) were inspired by Leonardo's individual pursuits in theatre, engineering, optics, geometry, physiology, anatomy, history, architecture and art. This work has long been seen as "Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance".</p>

As part of The Eco Everest Expedition 2011, Apa made his 21st Mount Everest summit in May 2011 then retired after a promise to his wife to stop climbing after 22 ascents. He first summited Everest in 1990 and his last time to the summit was in 2011.</p><p>Apa met Edmund Hillary many times, and was on the Expedition with his son Peter Hillary in 1990, which was the first summit for both of them. Apa estimates he has been through the Khumbu Icefall about 1000 times and almost went with Rob Hall's ill-fated 1996 expedition.</p><p>When questioned about stopping at 21, Apa stated: "Everyone says 21 is a good number. I have to make my family happy. Every time I go, they worry because Everest is very risky."

</p><p>Although well over 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in height, the Appalachian Mountain Club doesn't consider North Carter a "four-thousand footer" because the col on the ridge from Middle Carter only descends 60 feet (18 m), making it a secondary summit of that peak.

(The word Mecca is only used once in the Quran in verse 48:24 ("and it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within [the area of] Makkah after He caused you to overcome them. And ever is Allah of what you do, Seeing."))</p><p>Most Muslims believe Mecca and Bakkah are synonyms, but to Muslim scholars there is a distinction: Bakkah refers to the Kaaba and the sacred site immediately surrounding it, while Mecca is the name of the city in which they are both located.</p><p>According to Lisān al-‘Arab of Ibn Manẓūr, the site of the Kaaba and its surroundings was named Bakkah due to crowding and congestion of people in the area. The Arabic verb bakka (بَكَّ), with double "k", means to crowd like in a bazaar. This is not to be confused with another unrelated Arabic verb bakā (بَكَىٰ) (single k) which is the past participle of yabkī (يَبْكِي), to cry.
