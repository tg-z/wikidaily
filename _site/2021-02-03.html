His nickname was "Ciaschiteddu" or "Cicchiteddu", translated from the Sicilian alternatively as "little bird" or as "wine jug". 
</p><p>"Ciaschiteddu" Greco was the first "secretary" of the first Sicilian Mafia Commission that was formed somewhere in 1958. That position came to him almost naturally because he headed one of the most influential Mafia clans at the time, which went back to the late 19th century.

It is equipped with a 113 horsepower (85 kW) four-stroke 60° V-twin engine with electric-start, liquid cooling and electronic fuel-injection.  The engine is broadly similar to that fitted to the Aprilia SL1000 Falco.
</p><p>With its hard-shelled panniers, the Futura was intended to compete with the similarly styled Honda VFR800, but poor sales and Aprilia's worsening financial position led to the Futura's demise.  Production ended in 2003, although the bike remained in the range until 2005.
