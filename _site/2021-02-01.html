The cation [R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>N<sup>+</sup>=O] is of interest for the dehydrogenation of alcohols.  Oxoammonium salts are diamagnetic, whereas the nitroxide has a doublet ground state.  A prominent nitroxide is prepared by oxidation of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl, commonly referred to as [TEMPO]<sup>+</sup>.  A less expensive analogue is Bobbitt's salt.
