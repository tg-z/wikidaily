Planet Earth</b></i>) is a French animated TV series directed by Albert Barillé. The series was initially broadcast since 22 December 2008 on France 3. This series was the belated finale of the <i>Once Upon a Time...</i> educational television franchise, and its original premise was set up from "Once Upon a Time... the Earth (and Tomorrow?)", the final episode of the first series <i>Once Upon a Time... Man</i>, thus finally going back to the beginning where it all started and ended. The series' premiere also coincided with the 30th anniversary milestone of said educational animation franchise.

The judging of the World Championship is done by 'peer review', in that all competitors collectively decide the winner, together with a select panel of invited judges from the press and aftermarket industry.</p><br><br>
