</p><p>Von Stolz attended the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna and made her debut at the local Kammerspielen. She subsequently performed at various theaters in Vienna and in the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin.
</p><p>She made her debut in film in 1928 under the pseudonym "Helen Steels".  That same year, she moved to Berlin. In her second film role, she played the lead role opposite Reinhold Schünzel in <i>Don Juan in a Girls' School</i>. Von Stolz began performing under her real name starting in 1933.  She established herself as a major film actress although she had to be satisfied with major supporting roles that usually portrayed elegant ladies and femmes fatales such as the actress Lydia Link in <i>The Dreamer</i>.
</p><p>Von Stolz had planned to emigrate from Germany but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 frustrated those plans. During the war she worked in a number of Nazi propaganda films, the most widely known of these was her role as the wife of Duke Karl Alexander in Veit Harlan's <i>Jud Süß (1940)</i>.  After the war, she acted only rarely in films.
</p><p>After her death in 1973, she was buried in the family vault.

The museum closed at the end of 1997.
</p><p>The airport was originally known as Florence Army Airfield, or more simply as Florence Field, a World War II U.S. Army Air Corps / U.S. Army Air Forces training field for P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk pursuit aircraft and A-20 Havoc and A-26 Invader attack aircraft. Because of its former military connection and available runways, the military was able to fly in aircraft and leave them at the museum as they were retired from service.
</p><p>The museum was founded by Thomas C. Griffin. After the war, he served as executive director of the Florence Airport.
</p><p>During the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the museum built up a collection of World War II and Cold War era U.S. military aircraft and early 1950s/1960s military space hardware.  The museum was located along routes once frequented by travelers between the southeastern and northeastern United States and between Florence and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but once Interstate 95 was built, attendance declined.  The museum closed on 8 October 1997 and much of the collection transferred to the newly established Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina.
