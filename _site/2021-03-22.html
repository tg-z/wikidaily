</p>
<p><i><b>Duke Nukem Forever</b></i> is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and published by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the fifth installment in the <i>Duke Nukem</i> series and the sequel to 1996's <i>Duke Nukem 3D</i>. <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> entered development in 1997 at 3D Realms and was finished by Triptych Games, Gearbox Software, and Piranha Games between 2009 and 2011. In the game, the player controls Duke Nukem, an action hero who must come out of retirement and save the world from aliens when they begin kidnapping the women of Earth.
</p><p><i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> was originally announced in 1997 as the follow up to <i>Duke Nukem 3D</i>, but was thought to be vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule, which saw the game being delayed numerous times and had 3D Realms, which was being underfunded and laying off staff in 2009, become involved in a lawsuit with publisher Take-Two Interactive. In 2010, Gearbox took over the game's development and finished the game on behalf of 3D Realms. Finally released on June 14, 2011, <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> earned mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the graphics, dated humor and story, simplistic mechanics, and unpolished performance and design.

It is faintly visible to the naked eye, having a combined apparent visual magnitude of +5.60. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 15.39 mas as seen from Earth, it is located around 212 light years from the Sun. The system is deemed to be a member of the Sirius supercluster of stars that share a common motion through space.</p><p>The primary, component A, is a white-hued A-type subgiant star with a stellar classification of A4 IV. It is a microvariable, showing a 0.0056 change in magnitude with a frequency of 0.16245 times per day. Epsilon Pyxidis has been catalogued as an Am star, although this remains uncertain. It has double the mass of the Sun and radiates 19 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,368 K.</p><p>In addition to a close companion of unknown type at an angular separation of 0.17 arc seconds, the primary shares an orbit with a binary star system, components B and C, that lie at an angular separation of 17.8 arc seconds. At the estimated distance of this system, this corresponds to a projected separation of around 1,150 AU. The B/C pair consist of visual magnitude 10.5 and 10.8 stars with a mean separation of 0.3 arc seconds. They have estimated mass of 90% and 95% that of the Sun, respectively.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Forbidden Broadway: 20th Anniversary Edition</b> is the sixth volume in the Forbidden Broadway Cast Albums. Although there isn't a show with the same title, the CD has twenty-five of Forbidden Broadway's best songs, including eight previously unreleased tracks. It was conceived, created and written (parody lyrics) by Gerard Alessandrini.
</p><p>The CD bears the label "The Ultimate Unreleased Un-Original Cast Recording," pointing out that this does not exclusively feature the original cast.  The liner notes give a retrospective of Forbidden Broadway's beginnings, as well as a gallery of photos of the original cast with the stars they mock so lovingly.
</p><p>This CD returns the parodies of such shows as <i>Ragtime</i>, <i>Annie</i>, <i>Into the Woods</i>, <i>Cats</i>, <i>Martin Guerre</i>, and <i>Les Misérables</i>. Stars like Julie Andrews, Mandy Patinkin, and Patti Lupone also share the ridicule.
