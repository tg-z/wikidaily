</p>
<p>The <b>cinnamon-throated hermit</b> (<i>Phaethornis nattereri</i>) is a species in the hummingbird family, Trochilidae. It is found in a broad dry to semi-humid belt along the southern edge of the Amazon Rainforest from far north-eastern Bolivia north-east to Maranhão in Brazil. Its natural habitat is tropical dry to semi-humid forest, Cerrado and woodland. With its wide range, it is considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.</p><p>There is quite some confusion about the taxonomic status of birds called <b>Maranhao hermit</b>. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the cinnamon-throated hermit, but at present most follow the analysis by Hinkelmann where it merely is considered the male plumage of <i>P. nattereri</i>. But as it seems, the Maranhao hermit only occurs in the northern part of the range of <i>P. nattereri</i>, and as the two have different voices they seem to warrant recognition as distinct species <i>P. maranhaoensis</i>. It is pending of confirmation by molecular work. When treated as a separate species, Maranhao hermit is endemic to the Brazilian states of Piauí, Maranhão, Tocantins, Pará, Mato Grosso and Goiás, where it breeds during November–April.</p><br><br>
