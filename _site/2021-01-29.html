</p>
<p><i><b>Scarlet's Hidden Treasures</b></i> is an EP that accompanied the <i>Welcome to Sunny Florida</i> live DVD set released by singer-songwriter Tori Amos in 2004. The EP features six non-LP tracks, though several were featured on a web project called "Scarlet's Web" (see <i>Scarlet's Walk</i> for further information on the web project). 
</p><p>The track "Apollo's Frock" was partially conceived in 1996 during a live performance of "Doughnut Song" from the <i>Boys for Pele</i> era. Amos has consistently stated that she was unaware of the song's origins dating back so early. "Mountain", a song featured on "Scarlet's Web", was not released as part of this collection, and still remains unreleased.
