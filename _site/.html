A "twelve-note <i>spatial set</i> made up of the eleven intervals [between consecutive pitches]."  There are 1,928 distinct all-interval twelve-tone rows. These sets may be ordered in time or in register. "Distinct" in this context means in transpositionally and rotationally normal form (yielding 3856 such series), and disregarding inversionally related forms.</p><p>Since the sum of numbers 1 through 11 equals 66, an all-interval row must contain a tritone between its first and last notes, as well as in their middle.

</p><p>
The band's frontman Les Claypool said of the song: </p><blockquote><p> "John the Fisherman" was written so long ago. I like to write about things I know about so that I don’t sound like a dipshit talking over my head. I fish. Some dads take their kids to football games or baseball games. My dad took me fishing. That’s what we did, almost every weekend. My uncle, my grandfather, that’s what we did. It’s a big part of my history. So, for me, it was always easy to write about. These fishing songs kept popping up, themes about the ocean, and it made it like a chronicle, a subdivision of our body of work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The live version of "John the Fisherman" that appears on <i>Suck on This</i> contains an intro consisting of the intro to the 1981 Rush instrumental "YYZ".
