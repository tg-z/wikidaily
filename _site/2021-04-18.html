McDonald Peak is situated within the Flathead Indian Reservation.

McDonald Glacier is on the north slope of the peak.
</p><p>During the summer the summit and surrounding area are inhabited by grizzly bears for the purpose of feeding on insects. Consequently, in the interests of conservation and safety, the area is closed to hikers between July 15 and September 30.</p>
