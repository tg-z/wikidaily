<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=65740838>R package</a><br><p><b>R packages</b> are extensions to the R statistical programming language. R packages contain code, data, and documentation in a standardised collection format that can be installed by users of R, typically via a centralised software repository such as CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). The large number of packages available for R, and the ease of installing and using them, has been cited as a major factor in driving the widespread adoption of the language in data science.</p><p>Compared to libraries in other programming language, R packages must conform to a relatively strict specification. The <i>Writing R Extensions</i> manual specifies a standard directory structure for R source code, data, documentation, and package metadata, which enables them to be installed and loaded using R's in-built package management tools. Packages distributed on CRAN must meet additional standards. According to John Chambers, whilst these requirements "impose considerable demands" on package developers, they improve the usability and long-term stability of packages for end users.</p>

<img src=><br><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=94057>Tetris Attack</a><br><p class="mw-empty-elt">
</p>

<p><i><b>Tetris Attack</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Panel de Pon</b></i>, is a 1995 puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A Game Boy version was released a year later. In the game, the player must arrange matching colored blocks in vertical or horizontal rows to clear them. The blocks steadily rise towards the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. Several gameplay modes are present, including a time attack and multiplayer mode.
</p><p>Produced by Gunpei Yokoi, <i>Tetris Attack</i> was released as <i>Panel de Pon</i> in Japan, featuring fairies as the main characters with a mythical, fantasy setting. International versions instead replace these with characters and settings from <i>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</i>. Though international releases have the name <i>Tetris Attack</i>, the game bears no relation to the <i>Tetris</i> video game series, leading Tetris Company co-founder Henk Rogers to regret giving Nintendo the license to use the name. Both <i>Panel de Pon</i> and <i>Tetris Attack</i> were later broadcast through the Japan-only Satellaview peripheral, the latter renamed to <i>BS Yoshi's Panepon</i>.
</p><p><i>Tetris Attack</i> was well-received by critics for its graphical style, addictive gameplay and multiplayer modes, with some noting the North American version was superior to the original Japanese release. It was followed by a series of sequels and remakes for multiple platforms, most of which instead use the name <i>Puzzle League</i>. The game is referenced in other Nintendo games, such as the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> series, <i>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</i>, and <i>Captain Rainbow</i>.

</p>
<p>The <b>2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa</b> is an international rugby union tour that is scheduled to take place in South Africa in 2021.</p><p>The British &amp; Irish Lions are scheduled to play a three-match test series against South Africa. Unlike previous series, where the Lions played seven additional games against local teams, in 2021 there will only be five additional games, making a total of eight.</p><p>Possible candidates to coach the 2021 Lions included Warren Gatland, Eddie Jones, Gregor Townsend, Joe Schmidt, Dai Young and Mark McCall. Subsequently, in May 2019, Warren Gatland agreed to take charge of the team for the third successive time, with both parties agreeing to the deal. Gatland was officially unveiled as the 2021 coach on 12 June 2019.</p><p>Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports started emerging in early 2021 that the tour could be held in the British Isles instead of South Africa, postponed to 2022 or cancelled altogether.</p><p>With the Lions traditionally being a touring side only, many fans opposed the move with thousands signing a petition to put pressure on the Lions board to keep the tour in South Africa and postpone till 2022. 1997 Lions tourist, Tim Stimpson put his backing behind the campaign.</p><p>In January 2021, Rugby Australia offered to host the tournament in Australia if it could not be held in South Africa. This offer has been rejected.</p><p>In March 2021 it was confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned.</p>
