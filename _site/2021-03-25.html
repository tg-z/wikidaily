Its vertex coordinates (labels) are the permutations of the first <i>n</i> natural numbers. The edges identify the shortest possible paths (sets of transpositions) that connect two vertices (permutations). Two permutations connected by an edge differ in only two places (one transposition), and the numbers on these places are neighbors (differ in value by 1).
</p><p>The image on the right shows the permutohedron of order 4, which is the truncated octahedron. Its vertices are the 24 permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4). Parallel edges have the same edge color. The 6 edge colors correspond to the 6 possible transpositions of 4 elements, i.e. they indicate in which two places the connected permutations differ. (E.g. red edges connect permutations that differ in the last two places.)

It is the end station of line 10 and line 11 and was opened on 30 October 1977, as the 91st station and part of the one-station extension from T-Centralen. The platform is located approximately 34 meters underground. The station features relics rescued from the many buildings pulled down during the redevelopment of central Stockholm during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the station.</p>

<p>The entrance to the station was originally intended to be in the park Kungsträdgården, but due to the Elm Conflict in 1971 these plans had to change.
